0,I bought these airdopes in oct 2021 and exactly after a year few days in oct 2022 they stopped working out of nowhere. They worked great for a year. I had no issue no problems and i took care of them too idk why it suddenly stopped working. The problem started when it stopped charging 2-3 days back and the person whom i took it to repair said that jack is gone. Although it worked amazing for me for a year but then also only one issue was that on call the receiver was not able to hear my voice properly and even if i send voice chats. Overall I didn‚Äôt expect it to stop working like this. Short life span maybe! Hope it helps if someone is willing to buy!
1,I got this during Amazon Great Indian festival for 700rs and I guess its my best buy. Since you would not regret owning this which does its job on its best. Sound quality is good.. Bass is fine and Noise cancellation works fine too.Go for it only if you are looking for airdopes under budget.
2,I am using this product with overall good sound quality but there was problem in battery life. The intensity of single charge of ear bud was very low.
3,Its a pretty cool product very fast delivery and good sound quality only problem it again and again falls from ears .But value for mone
4,Display was not work perfectly üò†But this item in this price is good ü•∞üëç
5,"Sound quality is good. Noise reduction just works fine. Fits perfect in the ear. Battery backup could have been a little better. Battery lasts for just 4-5hrs on continuous use. But on one full charge, you can use it for 2-3 days with minimum usage of 20 - 30 mins.."
6,"Overall Product is good it's sound is also good, but sometime it does not hold in ear properly while walking or running."
7,"Overall it's a good product.One thing I like that it has a button instead of touch sensor. Because touch sensor will detect even slightest of touch.It once fell in water and still it's working fine.Noise cancellation is okok. You can talk on call with this buds on. But the other side won't be able to hear you if you're using this outdoor.Bass is good.It doesn't fit properly in the ear, it keeps falling from my ear. Can't wear them outdoor.Sometimes one of the earbud doesn't work.then I've to put both back in the case and connect again and it works fine then. There are scratches on the button."

32,Quality of sound
33,Satisfied with the costIt is worthy
34,Liked the product but could have given some noise cancellation
35,Wonderful sound quality and battery backup
36,THE SOUND QUALITY WAS QUITE IMPRESSIVE FOR THIS BUDGET.NOISE CANCELLATION IS GOOD.BASS QUALITY WAS BIT LOW.COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED IN BASS QUALITY.WHEN I WAS CONNECTING FIRST TIME WITH THE PHONE THE BUDS WERE CONNECTING SEPARATELY.THEN I KEPT IN THE BOX AND TOOK IT BACK AGAIN.AFTER THAT BOTH THE BUDS WERE WORKING TOGETHER.COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED THE CONNECTIVITY.THE DISPLAY INSIDE THE BOX WERE SCRATCHED A BIT.I HAVE BEEN ADDED THE PHOTO WITH THIS REVIEW.COULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN A PROTECTION STICKER FOR THE DISPLAY.THE MIC QUALITY WAS ALSO GOOD AND THE BATTERY WAS ALSO GOOD.OVERALL THIS WAS A GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY PRODUCT FOR THIS BUDGET.

¬†The product it overall ok, good sound quality and best looking. When it comes to my home the product was not charged at all, please do charge them before using it. Nice product in cheap price.üëå Just go for it!"
38,"Good (with music) ,worst (phone call) with money value(Rs-799).But bass is not so smooth like any other boat product.some type of bass hit the ear membrane badly when it is in high volume.Again some bass sounds good.Noise problem in phone call."
39,Value for money. A Descent ear buds with some good connectivity and good sound quality.There is no noise cancellation so do not fall for it.Buy it if your necessity is good music and okay-ish sound clarity with microphone / calls.Go for other products if you have more expectations like noise cancelation / clear bass sound etc..
40,Seems to be big out side can be little bit small/light weight
41,It's good product
42,Clear sound. No issue in listening music and talking over phone. Serve the purpose.
43,I just bought the product and its look so nice with its sound quality & i most likely its tiny shape where it can be easily fit in any pocket and no one knows that u have airdrops take it out and turn it on and say #IAmAboAthead
44,"Yss its bass quality is not too good but at a price of 799 boat is providing a very legit and ultimate thing that you can purchase without any hegitation  and personally i prefer this to every person who have a low budget and want tk buy earpods ,  I think this must be you first choice buddies .Loved this product since last 2 years ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

51,The sound and battery life are good ..Only problem is they dont seem to fit properly .There is always a fear that they might drop off
52,Worth it's price
53,Sound quality little low compared to other Boat bluetooth headsets
54,A little more improvement in noise cancellation rest all great
55,"Its fit perfectly in ear. Sound quality is average. There is no big bass effect. But if you are a melody lover and loves to listen music or videos in an average sound, then this will be worth your money."
56,Very low bass but quality of sound is good. But you are looking for music go for boat141. I had experience both and i like boat141 better than boat121.
57,"Good Quality & sexy look, but But the sound quality is not as desired other good!"
58,Good
59,Liked on its battery and charge life. Ease on ears.Easy to carry in pockets.Sound and bass also microphone is not as expected on quality. Much of noise is not cancelled at all. Its like my voice is also cancelled.Have to keep in full volume to listen to a normal sound music which is not good.My sister had purchased same headset which had in one percent volume a full good quality sound hence I had bought the same one.But I did not in same quality as my sister had got.I had no choice but to adjust with it.The quality changes when you make up as a brand that is what I had realised.Bit disappointed as music was my most happiness and I was worth to pay anything which is fair price for a headset and to its quality.But not expected enough on it.Thank you!

118,"I like many things so instead talk about what i dont like, we cant talk to somebody in very slow voice as they cant hear us as there is no speaker in it, so yes difference between wireless and wired earphones. Wish these problems can be solved too so we can talk in slow voice too in wireless pods."
119,"Works fine. There is no voice control and the color is not as pretty as advertised. The range is limited. Connectivity breaks up if you are 5 meters away. There is 1 year warranty, charging cable, and spare earbuds inside."

126,Good
127,"Sound is good enough, but do not expect noise cancellation in a typical Indian street. The product is good for use within home, and with limited movement. I tried using it while walking/jogging but it loses Bluetooth connectivity and even falls off from your ears. So I'm generally using it while lying on the bed listening to music or making a few calls while strolling on the terrace. The battery lasts enough for my usage of 2-3 days, and the set gets charged quickly, within 30 min-1 hour. Overall, a good product at this price range."
128,Good
129,When used to play music the sound was kinda low but the bass was good it is a good product if you need it for only listing songs or games. I'm a person who has to be on call most of time and many of my callers complained about not being able to hear me properly. My voice used to eco and BG was more audible then my own. I guess this product doesn't support Redmi phones.
130,Good product but no noise cancellation.
131,"Absolutely atrocious design. Pressing the mfb button(the only button it has) is inevitable. U will end up pressing it while trying to adjust it in your ear which, mind you, you're gonna be doing a lot of. The earphones fail to stay in the ear and the fit is bad. Sound quality is decent, nothing too great, but these are not very practical. Buying it at anything more than ‚Çπ700-800 is a bad deal."
132,"This is a good earphone for those who just want to listen to songs, watch movies etc. The microphone is really weak. You will have to shout if you want to get your message through while talking."
133,When I got this I tried I felt like the voice is much lesser than the one buds of realme and not at all good for calling zero noice cancellationReturn period was too long
134,"Sound quality is good but there are few interruption when it's away from phone. Microphone quality is not quite good there is no noise cancellation in this hence you cannot talk on a call when you are out or when you are in traffic, or even when you are sitting in a quiet room, the person on other side of call can hear everything around you and believe me it's bad. Talking about Bass quality, it is not so impressive either, well what you can expect in this price range üòÖ"

¬†Though I see many negative reviews around here, my product is fairly good. Like, I purchased it before going to hostel, initially they used to fell easily, it fell from even 2 floors, broke into 2 halves, but it was fixed at the same time just by pressing. The charging box also fell a decent number of times, there was time it got loose but it got fixed up without doing anything.Build Quality is good enough 5/5 (for a person like me who's not good at handling phone and earbuds)Mic is just useless (1/5)Sound Quality is decent, good enough (3.5/5)Battery backup lasts for 2-7days atleast. (4.5/5)Bluetooth range is fairly comparable to my headphones. (4/5)Charging indicator is sometimes not accurate (4/5)An earbud can't be better than a headphone. You can still use it for gaming. It has fairly low/decent latency.Value for Money (5/5)"

153,nice product
154,Good product in this range. All together average product.
155,Overall Good product at rate.but receaver is slightly weak.
156,The sound quality is great. One charge can last really long.My only problem is that you need to talk louder if you get a call while wearing this. It is expected as there is not mic like in earphones but that was a minor inconvenience.
157,Need to improve their bass and volume of the sound. Even if I play in 10 I hear like playing in 4. This needs to be improved
158,"Overall a v.gud earbuds. Battery backup is good, i only charge once a week or 10 days. Only issue is mic receiver v need be loud enough while on a call."
159,Good but two thing I don't likeIt comes with micro usb type not with type c cable next one one is button type sensors not touch sensor thats it over all good for 999 price and noice cancellation is ok and buds will play only 3 hours ...
160,Sound becomes More Used to
161,Very satisfied to get this earphone in this range. !!Thanks Amazon for suchba lovely productDelivery was prompt
162,Sound is good when listening song but call clearity is not soo good.battery backup is ok.blutooth connectivity range is not soo impressive. Overall a good product.
163,Sound is not that great. You can easily differentiate performance from a good headphones. Noise cancellation is good. I have used it in bus and trains. Problem faced by me was very minimal. Battery is the main usp of this device. Packaging and build quality is also good.
164,With the offered price no other product is as good as this. And Name justifies the quality of product.
165,Sound quality - 5/5Noise cancellation - 5/5Bass quality 5/5Battery backup 5/5Mic 1/5if you're also using/buying to listen to music it's worth all bucks but for calls I'd not suggest you to buy this.
166,Nice
167,Volume should have been more.
168,Writing review after 3 months of regular usage.1. Fairly good sound quality in this price range.2. Bass boosting quality is also good.3. Notice cancellation is really great. Any sound below 120dB (sound of an aeroplane) is blocked.4. The case takes around 2 and half hours to charge from 0% to 100%.5. Each airdope has a runtime of 3 hours or more.6. The case can charge the airdopes for atleast 4 times to 100%.7. Do not use the aordopes while driving or walking on road. It has a great noise cancellation and you wont be able to hear the minimum noisenof traffic which can lead to accident.
169,I like this sound quality is good .i hope this is original.
170,Budget friendly product. Only disadvantage is that the volume is too low to understand.  Ppl at the other end is unable to hear u properly.  Noise cancelation is good but do not use it for too long since it'll give a headache.

188,Bass is very poor. Okay for office call but not for music lover
189,"I have used Ptron, Noise, Mivi etc brands for airdopes, but I found Boat to be best among all of them.Advantages:Superb mike quality for calling.(I didn't found in any of the brands mentioned above)Sound quality and Noise cancellation is amazing, if you r not a pro gammer and all and want it for daily use or office work or routine songs then go for it. They are best for you.Battery backup is average. one charge can last you for 2 days. It is good for me I m satisfied with this.The design feature is my personal favorite, actually I felt it difficult to put in an out the earpods from box for that long design. but it is more wider and have enough space in box so easier to put in and out.No sensors, no tension of unitended calls, music etc. easy to use.Go for it if you r looking for longer term use and easy use."

247,"I had been using iPhone XR since November 2020 and bought Apple Airpods even before buying this model. Being an audiophile (An audiophile is a person who is enthusiastic about high-fidelity sound reproduction. An audiophile seeks to reproduce the sound of a live musical performance, typically in a room with good acoustics) I love Bluetooth earbuds by Marshall, Apple Inc (Apple Airpods), BOSE and Beats Audio because of balanced bass & treble. I am mostly into blues from the 60s and 70s, hard rock from the 80s, and sometimes country and folk rock musical genres. Hence, finding an alternative to the Apple Airpods within budget was a little difficult until some research and recommendations help me in my purchasing decision. I have always hated deep bass as it muffles background music. But boAt AIRDOPES 121v2 won my heart as it has got balanced treble and bass which is perfectly ideal for the kind of musical genre I am into. Also, my playlist has some dubstep and chill music which also sound great on these earbuds. I have also shared a screenshot of how it connects well with the laptop."

300,Writing a review after using it for 3 weeks. These are hands down the best for this price range. Sound quality is very good if u are using it for music. Calls are pretty decent too. The other person can hear you clearly. You can go for it. It has an amazing battery life too. But make sure u read the instructions for charging. Do not listen to people who are hating this product. It's very very decent.

I think boat give us wrong information that 14hrs playback but i think its gives backup more then 14hrs.

Think before once before buying."

319,It is absolutely lightweight and comfortable to wear. Easy to set up and use. The battery indicator LED on the case is very helpful. I use it mainly for listening to audio while walking around so it serves the purpose very well. Tried WhatsApp call with it but the other side said there was a lot of feedback and echo from my end so am not using it for calls. But totally happy with it as a comfy companion for walks using one ear only and for doing chores around the house with these on.
320,"The earbuds are really good and it is noise cancellation. Earbuds box is a bit delicate type like a bit near the cap, the cap is moving little. But other then that it works well and battery lasts long. The blue earbuds colour it's good and elegant."

If I leave the case with earbuds in for overnight it goes from 76 to 42. But they have great music quality & good noise cancellation as well. Definitely worth it for the price

Bass could've been deeper, but this is tweakable with apps/software. Rich enough, excellent to swing around while listening to music or podcasts. Turns off automatically when not in use; can be powered back on again with a 3 second press.

I bought this especially for using attending online meetings or long personal calls. There is no other purpose coz sometimes if the phone battery is down it's challenging to use with earphones.The sound quality is ok while listening to anything but while making calls, I can hear clearly but the person another side can not hear anything when I am speaking with them.This is the only issue I found.

515,"I bought these in the great indian sale for ‚Çπ999TLDR;- Good sound and mic- Comfortable- Good quality- Decent battery life- Value for moneyFull review:- Firstly, the build quality. It feels sturdy and has magnets for the lid as well as the buds themselves. The case also has a satisfying click when closed :)- The buds are very lightweight and fit comfortably in the ears.- As soon as you pull out a bud from the case, it will get connected if you've paired with a device. As soon as you put it back in the case it'll disconnect. The magnet is strong and doesn't open when dropped :p- Sound quality is excellent for the price. If you connect with a device and the sound quality is bad or breaking, try closing any tabs/apps using the mic. Bluetooth headsets loose quality when mic is being used.- The percent displayed on the case is beautiful. Also very useful to know how much charge is left in the case. The charge left on the buds can be check on the paired device- The device works in mono or stereo, depending on how many buds are outside the case.- The box was sealed with shrinkwrap as well as two plastic seals, one on either sides.- There is one clickable button on each bud, which multifunctions as play/pause, accept calls, google assistant trugger, turn on/off, and reset settings- The mic quality is apparantly good as well, based on my conversation with a friend- With low to moderate usage these have lasted over 3 days now, with 100% on the buds and 20% on the case- BoAt also seems to have good after sales support. One of friends had had his headphones replaced a few times. And they have physical service centers available.All in all these buds are a bang for your buck10/10 would buy again"

603,Lacks to provide clear audio output. Fails to perform effectively in larger surroundings.
604,Good sound
605,Nice product üòäBattery life is also goodIt just keep slipping off my ear half the time
606,Excellent product
607,I got at 899 in sale. Product is overall nice. Bass is average not so deep but sounds nice. (Bass lover will not feel satisfy)  sound is very loud at 100% volume i listen at 50-60% volume so in one charge it go upto 4.5-5 hr.plus 10 hr case charging enough for a day for myself.
608,"I bought these Airdopes by Beat on Amazon during the Diwali 2020 offer at a dirt cheap price of Rs. 999 only. The product arrived in a tight sealed box in a good condition. The case is nice & compact (your one finger size) with boat printed on top and a charging slot at its back. The box came with its own charging wire & some extra buds. At first the case opens and shuts looking a bit loose, but its just magnetic, so you'll get used to it.For a day or so the airdopes will consume enough battery from the case, which is normal as it even happens with new phones. So give it time. After a day, it performs better. So, if you charge the case to 100% and keep the earbuds inside the case, the battery drops really slow. Which is good. There is a digital display inside the case indicating the battery level and while charging it blinks as well, so you can see the charge level. (This was all about the case and while the pods are inside it).About the earbuds/pods itself, the aesthetics are sober, matt finished, and very sturdy even if you drop it hard. Comfortable to wear in my ears for prolonged hours. Both the earbuds have a click button where boat is written. With one click you can play/pause, attend a call, or with long press do various functions. There is no volume control (main drawback). Sound quality and bass is fantastic. Bluetooth connectivity is really good if the phone/laptop/any device is in close proximity. I gave 3 stars for connectivity coz the connectivity drops as I move from one room to another and need to have my phone in clear path or close to me. So, that's a bit annoying if you're on a call. But as soon as you come into the range of your device, it connects automatically and instantly. Keeping it balanced. It's great for music, watching movies, videos, call experience is ok ok (need to talk a bit loudly or cover your mouth for better experience). Battery life of the earbuds is fantastic. I use it for upto 24 hours or more at a single charge. I bought it mainly for music experience. Been over a month I'm using it just fine. No complaints."
609,"Sound quality is good, but lacks a little on noise cancellation"
610,good profomens
611,
612,Sometimes there is sound only from one ear pod and had to place in the box again for syncing the both earpods...The sound quality is good for general meetings or online classesNot so great for music
613,"Hello Team,I have bought boat airdopes 121v2 wireless last few Month. but suddenly its not Charging Fast as previous. it is taking so long time for charging or sometime it is not charging. Please replace it as soon as."
614,Worth for the money
615,Boat never fails to give you the best sound quality.
616,Super ‚ù§Ô∏è
617,"I got this earbuds on 21 April 2022 after 6 day but in 3rd day it's just 40km from My destination, so disappointed for delivery. Today 27 July so its 3 month review. I never use any earbuds before that so I cant compare. On fresh user besis it's great product in sound, bass, look, charging time(max 2 & half hour if 0%). I use it from morning 10 am to night 8 pm after charged 100% (not continuously) still it's on 7%. Active noise cancellation(ANC) is also good. Cant hear a voice front perons voice not totally. Its fall accidentally by myself and I see it's the dismental parts so got worried but that's not issue you can assemble it carefully. Take a time for assemble. Don't rush. After that incident still working good. Check it properly its fit in ear or not. This earbuds have a button so you can use it without confusion and easy. Just single press for stop music attend/cut call double press play music.  Different music play for call in earbuds. Battery indicator is a great feature. I still not configure a range coz never  far away from mobile so may be 7-8 meter. In the box just a old usb charging cable without adapter. Extra 4 rubber buds in package."
618,Sound quality is quite good. It does have nice noice cancelation... but after 1 month of use one bud stopped charging I've contacted Amazon service center and they gave me the number of boat service center I've claimed the warranty boat updated me that they replaced the device and it is yet to arrive.... (update: I got it replaced today and I must say boat service is too good as it was fast and I got the product replaced.)

They are most around sound quality.Sound, bass, noise cancellation all that come secondary but primarily an ear drop needs to have a good hold. It keeps failing easily. This feedback is based on regular usage of approx 2-3 hrs per day.I cannot even imagine doing a workout with these. So flimsy, poor quality product. No grip and this is not the first time I am using such a product. Rest please explore more for a better quality product even if it costs you a little more."

It's a great tws with good sound & bass2. Connects immediately with you device  whenever you take the buds outside the case  except for the first time3. Fits in your ear perfectly but there is a  disadvantage I'll tell you at the cons.Cons :1. If you're using the buds for the first time you  might feel some pain in your ears , but it  won't last long after using it for multiple  times2. The earbuds might slip out from your ears in  two conditions  (a) if your ears are wet ( i.e : during workout  and after bath  (b) if you are sleeping with the earbuds on  your either side of ear3. No Noise Cancellation4. The Lid of the case is very loose , it might  come out at any time5.

Call Quality is very worst , if your buying this  for calling purpose don't buy it"

777,REVIEW AFTER 6 MOTHS.PROS:- 1)VERY COMFORTABLE AND SOFT!¬°!!  2) AUDIO AND BASS QUALITY IS BEST!!!!  3) VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO  CARRY!!!!  4) FAST CHARGING !!!!  5) LONG BATTERY LIFE !!!!  6) GOOD FOR GAMING  7) EASY AND SUPER FAST  CONNECTING SPEED  CONS:- 1)POOR QUALITY MAGNET. AND  PULL OUT VERY EASILY BY SWING IN  AIR.  OVERALL THAT IS THE BEST PRODUCT OVER THIS PRICE SEGMENT.
778,In this price range this is nice product. Noise cancellation like other boat dopes very poor. Battery life is 5 6 hours approx.
779,Given warranty  of 1 year but its only after 4 month battery of the box  is not working properlyHaving  issue with charging case
780,Good
781,Good product
782,"This was the first wireless earbuds I ever bought. Safe to say, I was thoroughly impressed and will stick to wireless earphones from now on.ùó£ùóøùóºùòÄ:‚Ä¢ Great sound quality. Music on this is fantastic. Although the noise cancellation isn't perfect, it doesn't let in enough ambient noise to affect your enjoyment of the music. As a fan of rock music, guitar riffs, drum beats and bass lines are brilliant on these headphones.‚Ä¢ Good battery life. There aren't much to wireless headphones. Audio quality and battery life are the two technical aspects. The battery life on this product is very long. I use regularly for an hour or two per day and the battery lasts over a week usually.ùóñùóºùóªùòÄ:‚Ä¢ Not the most comfortable or clean. The rubber buds sometimes press into the inner ear and can slightly hurt your inner ear. The grooves on the pod also accumulate dirt a lot. It requires regular cleaning after prolonged use.Although much newer models are out, this product is a nifty device which helped grow the earbud market."
783,The top cover is loose and fragile. A possible problem at the hinge.
784,Good

792,I was very happy happy with this product. But I am giving it a 3 because one earpod stopped charging itself. I thought it's the charging box but its the pod itself. Its not holding charge either. Went from 60 to 20 in 10 mins with low volume usage. I really loved it but boat should do better with it.Battery-10/10 (6 months) spoiled after thatSound quality -7/10Bass-8/10Noise cancellation -7/10Overall-7 or 6
793,case light & weight / my7 days used but case very Craig's
794,I like this product
795,Noise cancellation is below average. Sound quality overall is good. Bass is OK.
796,The audio quality is just superb.And it's battery lasts for 3-4days if we use it daily for 5-6hours.Using it since 2 months and it's just commendable in such low price.So go for it if ur budget is under 2000rs. And you are expecting an amazing earphone.

And it has some connecting issues too.

Better to have Other product than this."

Other party keeps asking to repeat what you said... This is good product of you only want to use for listening to songs or watch YouTube videos. Pay some more and buy better quality product

1081,"Good packing and delivery. Lovely case with battery indicator on the charging case, the airdopes are of same color as case , the bud fits in each ear though can fall off easily on any movement. Handbook and wc provided. But all this doesn‚Äôt fulfill the quality of sound and Bluetooth connectivity by this particular earbuds- It‚Äôs very poor and keeps crackling even if the phone kept at close proximity or in pocket. The other person on line cannot receive the conversation and conveyed in bits pieces making a complete phone conversation very difficult- this is on stationary premises; travelling or vehicle commute might make it worse. Having 3-4 different brands hands free EarPods/earbuds, this by far is the least Bluetooth connectivity, poor service- overall not good investment."

From my experience, I could literally here each and every external sound clearly enough to distract my concentration while I was attending my online classesüòÇ The Quality of the product is really good and appreciable but the mic quality of the airdopes is kinda horrible especially during phone calls...

Not to forget, the battery is also average (not the best) but it's kinda funny to say that the charge gets reduced to 30% within few hours (after being completely charged to 100%)but once it gets 30%, it's lyk the charge stops decreasing and u can use the airdopes for another 2-3 hours..i hope u r understanding what I'm tryna say...

With Single charge i can use it for 4 to 5 days with an average run time of 4 hours per day. I bought it for 1299 rs, but was reduced after a week to 999 rupees that's a disappointment for me."

One will not be worked in same time, you to remove from your ear, put it again in case n then you can use it.Connectivity is very very very very very very very poor with call quality.I seriously recmmond you to not to buy this one even you are getting free, return it if someone try to gift you, break your relation with them but dont accept as gift.

Good thing that I was able to put it back together without damaging anything, so yup! It is worth the price and it nice for a birthday gift. I just wished that the battery lasted abit longer, had few issues with it. Overall a really nice product. Worked wonderfully for this one year. If handled well with care, I believe it will work for longer."

And the quality of the sound everything is really worth the money. Even the charging standby also amazing. Good for riders as these are easy to receive phones calls while riding.

1409,
1410,Best
1411,Product came as it is.. but it's mic is very very poor.. I had seen people talking very slowly also while using such pods so I thought to buy one but you need to scream or speak louder than you would usually do on phone aur wired earphone for the other person to hear you.. if u pause your music frequently then it might get disconnected on it's own or it would show it's connected but there would b no music.. then you turn off and on your bluetooth and keep the pods in case and then connect it again for listening again.&Once charged it could be used for good 4-5 hours that's what I have seen in my case.. I mean it's battery drained from 80 to 35 while one complete movie and continuous youtube sessions..
1412,"I've been using this product for almost six months now. I must say it is a supperb product by Boat. I always had an issue with the wired earphones as they stop working fast and it becomes difficult and time consuming to untangle them . But now as soon as I get these earbuds out of the box they connect to my device within 2-3 seconds. Talking about the sound quality it was decent and it enhances the quality of sound by its noice cancellation. It doesn't get out of the ears while dancing, exercising, jogging etc. I use it while I'm riding. Recently one of the earphone fell from my hand directly on the ground. Now I can feel something shaky inside while I'm running but the sound quality is the same. Boat should work on its built quality. Anyways for those who are switching from a wireless earphone to tws,this earphone is the best. It's cheaper, it has great battery backup and a branding like BOAT."

So business man/ salesman can't think for this..So u can buy only I u have low budget and want airdopes instead of handsfree....You can compared only with handsfree...

1556,"I bought this for 1k, I don't really care about sound quality much i needed it for the convenience. Having said that, the sound quality is fine, watching movies with these on is a delight. I mostly listen to audiobooks and in that perspective too, these are great. The only issue i have is whenever i attend a call with these on the reciver can't hear me clearly, sometimes they can't hear me at all, sometimes i sound muffled, bar that i think it's worth the price."
1557,I bought these airdopes and after one week left bud stop working. I don't know what to do.

1559,"The Airdopes are good for listening to music, podcasts, and audio, in general. But when you use it while talking on the phone, the individual on the other side can barely hear you. Voice reception is a problem with these - buy if only using this for listening to audio, music; however do not buy if you have a phone without an earphone jack."

1566,"Out of the two, one RHS Airdope failed within a few days of usage. It was not getting charged at all. That is the quality level maintained by them. I had gone for this product with a strong belief that Boat brand is reliable. But my hopes have been dashed. Talking about service and repair, in these days, who finds time to go to such great troubles of locating the Centres and getting them checked or repaired. Any how my experience was a bitter one with this particular product, and I have kept them aside without using them."

1572,I didnot felt any pros in this earbud ....Below are the Cons üëá1. Sound Quality Is very bad2. Noise Cancellation is below average3. On calls üìû the other person cannot hear clear voice of ours so obviously the mic is not good4. Battery üîã Drains Fast5. Takes nearly 2-2.5 hrs for charging from 31%to 81% very slow charging though my charger is of 33 w a i tried with 60 w charger also but same condition6.Does not have a touch sensor7. Has a micro Usb port for chargingShould have C type.chargingOver all review dont go for this buds...
1573,"This is a Good Product. Value for Money. Handy, Best Sound Quality.Buts removing from Box is little Problematic. But In this value this is acceptable.Amazon Delivery is Ok. Packing is not Good. Internal Box which is packed by Suppliers is not good. Packing must be perfect. Original BOAT Box is good. But seller ignore Packing system."
1574,The ear pod is very much nice beyond my aspectation
1575,"There are quality/reliability issues with this model. One of the earbuds stopped charging within the 10 day replacement period itself. The replacement product worked fine for 5 months, and then the same issue occurred and one of the earbuds stopped charging again. I think it was the same left earbud in both cases.I took it to boAt service center and they replaced my black Airdopes with the cherry blossom color since they  claimed to not have the black model available. However this doesn't reflect in the boAt records anywhere. The sound quality for this cherry blossom replacement was not upto the mark so I contacted customer care and they said they could not provide support for this cherry blossom replacement, provided by their own service center, as my model was supposed to be black in color. Telephone support was no help in this case, they even claimed that the replacement ticket filed by service center was for a cherry blossom model. So between their support and service centers, the end consumer gets taken for a ride.boAt is supposed to provide 1 year warranty however my 5 month old Airdopes are now out of warranty since they won't support their own service center replacements.The interesting thing I learned is that the 1 year boAt warranty is only on the original product, boAt can keep providing you faulty replacements for faulty original product, but after 1 year from original date of purchase they have no liability whatsoever. So effective lifetime of product is 1 year since it will stop working much sooner.UPDATE: I had to go via Twitter but did finally receive replacement pair - cherry blossom ones. They even shipped them to my home. The mic quality has never been what it was in my original black pair though, and I mostly don‚Äôt use my Airdopes as much as I initially did."

¬†The ear phones are quite loose and might no be used for workout. But can be used for listening to music or watching movies. The colour is really pretty. They look small compared to the videos and images. The only drawback is the case takes a long time charging. When I received the ear phones it only had 8% but I had to charge half a day to bring it to 100%. Other than that it is good for casual purposes."

It is a decent earphone under this rate and if you are looking under a budget or if you're a person who don't prefer to put much for earphones like me then it is a right choice I would say !!And it charges so quickly also the battery level stays the same for a quite long.

1626,"I've been a die hard fan of BoAt products for years but this one disappointed on multiple fronts.1) None of the provided buds gave a comfortable fit and we're distinctly uneasy to wear after half an hour.2) The Mic quality is extremely bad and even when sitting in a quiet room, the other party on a call cannot hear me clearly plus sound echoes.3) Zero noise cancellation... Forget it.I got suckered into buying it looking at the number of reviews and ratings but realised later that they are surely manipulated otherwise this product should not get a rating above 1."

It's the last product you would wanna go for, boat is an amazing company, I've been buying their products but i hate little details about then, how they are not maintaining quality anymore in their products"

And microphone is worst, you need to literally shout then the other person can hear. The right side ear peice has problem with charging, you need to slightly press and hold for a minute to start the charging."

1778,"I ordered this on 20 Dec 21 at ‚Çπ999/-It came instantly in 2 days on 22nd Dec.And they're really dope, ngl!It came charged with 77% battery in case.They also include two additional Earmuff for earphones in case you need to replace your current ones.It also includes a Micro USB charging cord, so you won't have to rely on your phone's charging wire.Its Bluetooth range is about 10 meters, so if you get too far away from the main device, they will disconnect, but they will reconnect as soon as you get back into range.The packing was neat and tidy. 10/10The sound quality is fantastic. 10/10Bass is also good, although it could be better 8/10.The mic quality could have been better. Noise cancellation is not available. 6/10Overall - 10/10TLDR - Worth buying; if you have more budget, try something else."

Because noise cancellation facility is not working.Mic: Poor. Need to speak loudly otherwise it couldn't catch voice.USB charger also a biggest drawback.Will update future if I face any difficulties or Pros."

1814,"ok, moderate... dont expect high..."
1815,"So the product works fine but the most annoying part is getting it connected to the device which takes FOREVER. I use apple ecosystem and it doesn‚Äôt work well with any of the devices. So in my brutally honest opinion, stay away if you‚Äôre planning to use it with iPhone/ MacBook/ iPad. Another annoying factor is the battery life. I‚Äôm not someone who likes charging a lot but this is the cheapest alternative out there so it‚Äôs expected that you‚Äôll have to charge frequently to use it."
1816,Sound qualify is not good
1817,If you are looking for strong and sharp base then don't go for this. It is ok in this budget but after using it i would say the sound quality is not up to the mark. It feels like you are listening to music in auto riskshaw. If you are low on budget and can compromise on sound quality then good else don't go for it.
1818,The person on the other end can hardly hear you when you are using this airdopes for calling.... there is no noise cancellation on the background ....Good for using while watching something on the phone
1819,Sound quality and play time is only 5 hours
1820,"Its been 5 months since I've use this device, so my honest review is - the sound quality is overall good, bass is not upto the mark but okay. The charging module when fully charged u can use it whole day, if u r a moderate user then it can last for 2 days. I dont use mic so I can't saying about it. Overall it is excellent at this price range & I'm happy with it"

The sound quality was good initially but deteriorated rapidly in month 3 to the extend that even in the highest volume I could barely hear well. It's better to spend more money and buy a JBL one

1908,"Bought this at ‚Çπ999, reviewing it after 3-4 days of usage. Huge fan of the colour, the case cap was not loose, which seemed a common complaint among other buyers. It autoconnects to devices once paired, which is very convenient. Battery life is amazing, have been using it for about 6-7 hours without charging it. Sound quality is great, not phenomenal- but above average for the price. Only issues I face are that the audio is interrupted sometimes if you move too far away from your device. Also, I'm not able to control the volume while connected to my laptop. One thing to remember is that the MFB is a button, and not touch interface.Update after two weeks of use: sometimes doesn't connect to devices, have to switch BT on and off. Doesn't process audio from mulitple sources at once, unlike regular earphones or headphones, i.e, if I'm on a video call, it won't pick up audio from other tabs/apps in the background :/ Battery life has definitely reduced.TL;DR- definitely worth it overall, at this price."

I bought it just a month ago and it seems okay for now, I've bought another version of the boAt airdopes and they didn't last until 6 months after purchase.

2001,"I have been using boat products for years now. This is not their best product. But it's not bad for 1200 for AirPods. Battery life is fab. Looks very good but it doesn't fit properly inside the ear so you will have to constantly keep putting in back so not the AirPods to buy if you planning to use it for running or workout coz it's a contant distraction to stop, put it back in the ears and resume back to workout every 5 minutes."
2002,I ordered it..I got it..I use it then I realise it is good for music but not capable for clear voice calls .then I ordered to replace it. In its replacement I got a used  Bluetooths. I m disappoint with this product.
2003,Overall good quality and amazing battery life. May be loose in one ear but that differs from user to user. Received it in perfect condition
2004,I've purchased this on 17th Jan 2022 I was quite happy with purchased coz this was worth the price but sad part is it did not last a month. my right earpod stop working now I believe that section where we charged git damage ( I hardly charge coz after one time charge stability is quit stays long )
2005,"This is the second one I've bought, and within 6 days one of the earphones stopped working, again. The same thing had happened with the last ones. It's fully charged, the left one's working fine, it's always the right one that stops working!"
2006,"Sound quality is good except for calls,the person on the other end of the call hears muffled voice."
2007,"The Airdops are of Nice quality and are very cute and compactable. The sound quality is also better compared to a few earrphones and airpods. They are fast charging, long life, look nice, and also very affordable. Overall they are superb in relation to their cost. You should definitely buy the."

2009,"I ordered this for my wife. She was disappointed with the build quality. Felt very cheap when compared to the OnePlus buds that I have. The price of course is cheaper than the OnePlus buds but it not only looks cheap, but its very flimsy too. One of the buds came apart after it fell from my hand. I managed to put it back together with a little effort.Overall I will rate it 3 stars. It does its job but it could have been made more sturdier. I dont think it will last that long."
2010,Good
2011,Battery issue mic doesn't work better
2012,product is working properly till now.
2013,Sound is mooth and good quality
2014,We using boat rockerz 255 it is better than this
2015,Bad thing is when talk to someone on call then you have to hold one earpod in hand because another person couldn't listen your voice. It's not right for call only for listen music with normal bass.Very disappointed with this product
2016,This product is Okay to me and it solves my purpose.
2017,Nice gift
2018,I didn't find it comfortable. May be my ears are not made for it. It hurts in ear.
2019,Very good
2020,"I am been using this product from 8 months, sound quality is good I can give 4 rating but when u call someone received person sound will not good at all, thr is not clear sound quality in call fr receiver and everything is good, I can use this product so long because i ear get pain and coming to charging it is super good. Once u completely charge it will use it more than 2 days"
2021,"I Worst quality. I have already returned it but without checking service Center returned just saying there were no problem.  Worst product deliver. Disgusting.What kind of service is this that once you say that it should be replaced and after that you say that it has become bad.  It was a very bad experience, now after today I will not buy any product from your app because of the people who cheat the customer by lying to him."
2022,Noise cancellation is not good.

2043,"I've been using it for more than week now. Not having any issue yet.Sound Quality:Based on what I paid.. sound quality is good. It does not sound cheap or very crispy. Bass is not upto mark but not that bad as well.Build Quality:Ear buds quality is nice. Does not feel cheap. But case quality could have been better. Case lead fills bit loose and very sensitive to scratches.Comfort:Earbuds feels bit pointy but it could be just me. And they DO NOT HAVE MUCH GRIP IN EAR. I have dropped them accidentally several times. They fell off easily even with moderate head swings.Battery Backup:It takes around 2 hours to fully charge the case. Earbuds lasts around 4 hours on medium volume. I got total back up of around 10 hours.Summary:If you are looking for budget ear buds I would suggest to go for this, But be careful people are getting refurbished/returned product. If you have more budget then 2k there are many better choices available."
2044,average good
2045,Good for song not calling
2046,I was excited for a moment but as soon as I got it I tried it the left side buds aren't working

2048,Shocked to see that boat being such a gaint in this market has manufactured these headphones. These headphones are really troublesome when you are on a call. People on the other end can't hear you clearly. I have replaced the product but still facing the same issue. Wish there was a option for return.
2049,Sound quality is good but the shape is really pathetic.It never fits in your ears unless you forcibly push them causing you pain and discomfort
2050,Nice thanks Amazon
2051,This is not the hassle-free product. Lots if problem is there.
2052,Product only good for first 9 months. Later it stopped charging the buds. If you are at some remote places in rajasthan you may get your product via online partners but if it becomes faulty no way to replace it. So don't buy boat products

¬†Received safely along with all original packaging, w-card, instructions etc. been using for few weeks.sound quality is excellent. cute carry-on case with charging. The back-up is straight 7-8 hrs (3-4hr aprox for continue movies and songs) and the carry case is itself a on-the-go charger.. so total back-up we can say is approx 10-12 hrs or more.sound, bass, noice cancellation, battery backup everything is perfect .. but the fitting..Its not comfortable to wear, easily falls off. I have to be always alert while wearing it. so thats a big nono for this product.The boxy shape doesn't fits inside the ear cavity that well. the earplug holds a bit but the design looses its fit.With consideration of all its good qualities, the design of product seems big fail. some holder attachement might help a bit."

And if you claim the warranty you never get it. They will send you worng image telling that is physically damaged. Where you know only that was stopped working only. No physical damage is there.Please use the product at your own risk.P.S dnt get any option to repair the product also.

2244,"Haven‚Äôt used EarPods for a while almost 2 years now, did this new purchase for workout and meditation let‚Äôs see how it goes so far the sound quality is good, though the charging -% is acting funny"
2245,"Quite a bad buy.It's been a month I am using it and I find the product quite substandard.To begin with, sound quality is nothing extraordinary to write home about. It's average. But not deal breaker.While the manual says the dock can charge the pods a couple of times, practically it can at best charge twice. Not very impressive.The fitting is also not very snug. Has high chances of falling off if you are not careful.The real deal breaker is connectivity.The pod keeps losing connectivity every 20-25 mins while watching a movie (haven't experienced it over calls) and it is quite irritation. Haven't figured out the reason yet. I need to wait for it to reconnect again, which it does.Call quality is also not very happening. The mic is not very sensitive and hence we need to talk louder to make ourselves heard.Overall, I would suggest that you pay slightl more and go for a better model."
2246,Noise cancelation is bad otherwise its a good product.
2247,"1.Mike is worst so you cant use it for calling purpose.If you receive defective product then dont expect return or replacement, I m waiting for replacement since last 20-25 days, its still showing as pick up planned."

2259,"one of the amazing purchase i ever made. for me, battery backup is about 7 hour 28 minutes per single charge at listening to music @70% volume. ear buds takes around 40-50 min to get charged from case @ consuming only 23% battery from case. so theoretically i can charge them upto 4.3 times.  case itself takes around 1 hour 20 min to get from 7% to 100% . my unit only shows charging upto 80% then it stays at 80%. but this is a glitch as I can assure it charges little more than that.pro:1. best battery life. upto 37 hour of music.2. charging time is great. 40 min from 0-100%3. built quality is good. never had problem connecting with any device. added bonus they work in mono mode too.con:1. lack of next/previous/volume up/down on ear buds. you can only control volume through your phone.2. sound cancellation is just OK.3. fitting is good. they will not fall off ear in everyday situation. but still cannot use when joging or doing any exercise. as there is not extra protection against fall.4. bass is non existent as in case of most of the budget wireless earbuds.at 999 rs it is best deal one could ever wish. truly happy and satisfied by them at this price range.p.s. this company is a German brand not Chinese."
2260,"This is a review for Airdopes 121v2 (version 2). For the price they are going at, ‚Çπ1300, at the time of writing this review, these offer great value.I was looking for earbuds that I could use (in mono mode) while riding a motorcycle, for directions and such; more so because my bike has the connected bike feature. So, my expectations from the buds were quite functional.But, surprisingly, these buds are good for listening to music too.Sound quality: The bass is good, and the treble and range are decent.Set up / pairing was easy and needed no additional effort.The LED display which shows the charge remaining in the case is a useful feature to help you to leave the house with full charge on. Again going back to my basic need for use on the motorcycle in mono mode, I expect that by alternating L and R pods, i can double the use per charge.So, overall happy with the buy. Long term reliability needs to be seen. But 20k+ high ratings tell me I have little to worry about."
2261,Got a very bad piece of this product. Damaged only within 2 weeks. Got very bad experience about this product.
2262,charging is very good audio and video pleyal sound is very good
2263,Little big for small ears. Fits well has a good sound quality at this price point i would definitely recommend. It has nice battery life .not great for gaming because of latency. but good for running or listening music.great earbuds.
2264,Mic is not good. Receiver can't here our voice clearly.Product have some scratches inside.
2265,Very good product
2266,Its good at this price. Its battery backup is also ok. But its voice quality is very poor one has to speak louder to make other person hear properly. It sometime slip down from the ear. Its only good for listening music and things same like this
2267,"The product was great. Great sound quality, decent bass and was quite comfortable to wearHowever, the left side airdope stopped working only after 4 months, even after contacting customer service, the response isn't great. So, I would personally recommend to buy another pair of earphones if you want more durability."

2278,It was easy to connect to phone. Overall I would give it a solid 4 out of 5. It was good to use. 2 extra sizes are given to adjust to ears. But it doesn't cancel noises. But they are better
2279,Jast for see YouTube
2280,Best in thise Budget segment. Value for money. Battery backup is more than enough.
2281,"The Eardopes are good for music, but for calling it's utter crap the other person won't hear you at all, plus you can't workout in those the music fluctuates like crazy. If it's worn for too long ears starts paining, therfor very comfort."
2282,Nice üëç product value for cost and having good and quite lovely features in it
2283,"voice when talking on the phone isnt that great. for watching any movies,its good but its not even holding onto the ear properly,falling off frequently. Not suggested"
2284,I got this delivered for my parents who without realizing that one of the air dopes is not working from the start itself kept on saying that they didn't know how to operate it. So now when I went back home this August I found out there was manufacturing defect with one of the pair. It is already 5 months now and the return window is closed. Now I want to get it replaced with a working piece. Looking forward for an early response from you.
2285,Highly disappointed
2286,Doesn‚Äôt fit properly
2287,"Bought this on Great Indian Festival Offer for ‚Çπ999 as Mrp was ‚Çπ2,999. I was so impressed & convinced with my decision of buying this instead of Redmi Earbuds 2C for ‚Çπ1,299.1) Case quality - Made of plastic. Looks premium but neither so good nor bad.2) Buds - They are so small & light weight. Buds size will be average for 20+ years age, but might be little big for people whose ears are small.3) Connectivity - Has Bluetooth 5.0, so no worries about connection loss, but common distance is 10m.4) Sound Quality - Sound is good but not so great @ this price range. Bass is decent, Trebles are good, mids & lows are Ok. Call quality is good without any voice break.5) Battery - Battery life is good, will give you around 3-3.5hrs playback on a single charge. Case give you 3 full times charging for the buds. Main highlight is the battery percentage which most brands doesn't give. Really good.6) Brand - Boat is one of the best brand in market for audio accessories. This brand never fails to give it's best for the customer. 1 year international warranty provided & service centres are good.Final verdict - Overall I would say if the buds price is ‚Çπ999 & your budget is under ‚Çπ1000, then definitely go for it. You won't regret buying it. But if this buds price goes over 1000+ then check for other options.Peace ‚úåÔ∏è"
2288,The product is working nice but battery life jis not so long. you need to plug in after 2 hrs so you can not use them both simultaneously. Overall good for limited use person. Sound  quality is not that great.ok ok as compared with price in entry level.

2309,"The product is good and so is the built quality and noise quality. But sometimes while listening to any saved songs or watching youtube videos, i have seen that , even though the bluetooth device, which is the phone, is close by 1 ft from the airdopes device, even then one of the 2 BT speakers is fading away, just for a moment or two..so i missed the sound for a second. I think its a BT connectivity issue,which should not be , in this case..the charger case also needs a slow speed charging point to charge itself,as mentioned in the booklet. Or else, you might end up damaging the entire item.It doesnt hv any remote to increase/ decrease volume....so everytime, phone as to be used change song."

2332,"This is such a waste, the sound quality is so poor that if you play music in high volume it will still feel like someone is whispering in your ears, you can't wear them for too long cause it makes your ears hurt, it keeps falling off the ear and rolling off. Just the battery life is fine but the good look of it is completely useless since it doesn't serve the purpose."

Even boat has headsets with better ear buds in this price range (wired headsets).Connectivity: In the 3 months that I used, never faced any bluetooth connectivity issues. The headset works as a single earpiece as well as double earpiece. The 2nd earpiece automatically syncs with the other pair when taken out of the case.Battery life: Comfortably gives more that 10hrs of playback time. And gives a very decent standby time.Quality of the case: Saw some reviews saying the case lid is bad. However, the quality of the case seemed to be same as that for OnePlus buds which sells at 3 times the price."

2531,This is my first TWS (True Wireless Stereo). I searched lots of TWS but that is not in my budget. Finally I decided to buy This Boat Airpods 121v2 Because It's Fit In My Budget.I received this product in 4 days. Packaging Is Good wrapped in plastic Bag.My Ratings (After Using 15 Days)Built Quality 9/10Bass 5/10Mic (Not Noise Cancellation) 9/10Battery Backup 7/10Charging Time 6/10Pairing 9/10 (Because It's Supports Bluetooth Version 5.0)You can you single Earbud because they both are master earbuds.Value For Money 9/10CONSThe case cap Is loose. It's is not for those people who wear helmet beause it is not perfect fit in helmet. Bass is average.
2532,For calling a bad and poor quality productSo not any purchase this itemIs this dull product and after that purchase not cancelled this so can't purchase
2533,"Sound is loud, fits nicely in ear, does not fall while running as well. Connects quickly, supports different audio codecs.But has few issue like weird bass in with few instrument sounds, has a very less distance coverage, usual 10m doesn't work with this, gets disconnected in just 5-6m.Been using for 2 days.. battery seems to working fine, not the best but with a 900 rs pods, its expected.Overall a good buy for the price"
2534,Olk so i used it 4 days this is what i think about this TWSBass and vocals is clear and decent if you have used mi basic or realme wired earphone then its their wireless avatar.remember you are using a 1000 rupee TWS so dont expect Samsung 15000 rupee worth of quality and sound.connectivity on first day was like wifi i used this earbuds from one room to other with putting phone in one room but didnot get any kind of trouble in connection BUT........ here comes the real problem after second day even my one hand outside earbuds was making connection problem so its totally hardware problem.quality of earbuds and box is horrible. box was looking like chor bazar ka item.i filed a replacement of the same let me check that one and will edit this if i find and pro or cons. thanks.

2539,"Hi Product owners/ manager,Please give a moment to read my report.I had a very good trust on Boat brand. In fact i loved Boat product.But today i thought Boat ear pods(air drop) will be good experience with TV. My first reason to buy this to connect to smart TV. But unfortunately it is not even working. i am experiencing the sound switch between my left and right pods frequently while connecting with smart TV.But working fine with my mobile.Please fix this issue or sell it with caption only for mobile.It will bring a good value for the product as well as brand."
2540,Battery back up is just like a joke for this device.
2541,"I was also one of the many people who got carried away to buy this product after looking at the 100k+ positive reviews but the reality is different. Battery does not last when needed, either the left side functions or the right one, it's a non reliable product when needed. Please take my advice and buy the Porton wired earphones which I used for more than 3 years with no issues, I thought of switching to a wireless one and looked at this product and I'm regretting it just 2 days after buying it! I consider myself lucky when both of the ear sets work together"

And most importantly it's been only 4 months now and the ""Right SIDE AIRDOPE ISINT WORKING"". The device is still in the warranty period, how to claim it????"
2573,The plastic is not of a premium quality. Colour  is good indeed. But the holder should hav been even better. Biggest prob is that wen v use it to take/make a call the other person cant hear our voice clearly. I hav to remove it n talk. Whats the point then.

I must say I want to give zero star.."
2585,"The earphones itself is good.but Quality control is non existent. My case and the right earbud was slightly scratched out of the box. But nothing that will effect the usability of the buds.The case seems solid, The lid feels cheap tho. The earbuds itself is a bit on the chunky side so if you want something smaller I'd suggest the Redmi Buds 2C.The audio quality is good with good bass and they fit decently comfortable in your ears.Connectivity is easy to set up and automatically connects if you take one pod out of the case after initial setup and pairing.one slightly annoying thing I've noticed is that you can't skip a track if you're using only one pod."

The design and battery backup is good. However, the Bluetooth connectivity is very weak and its best operated at 2X the wired distance. Anything beyond, the mic refuses to send voice to the device. Overall, I did not like the performance. It compares well with other cheaper options available under 1k.  Most feedback here seem a bit overrated.The replacement I received had only a single replacement ear bud. The first one had four. Seems they are just repacking returned items."

2695,extra noice catch during call and bluetooth bateery down in one hours
2696,Ptron earbuds are much better than this‚Ä¶. Pathetic sound quality and they are not even letting me return it
2697,Would not recommend this product as it doesn't solve the purpose of good music and calls
2698,Thak ha
2699,Regarding the Price it is satisfied. But for quality and life - we expect more as it is a boAt's product.
2700,Good product. But not capable of a minimum range requied otherwise good product and in a normal rate

2702,Value for money.....nothing more nothing less
2703,"Sound quality is good, but mic could have been a bit more better. One of my buds is not charging. Idk why but this was not supposed to happen."
2704,Only thing I dislike about it is I cannot control volume with the earphone... Volume up/down button were present in my earlier boat rockerz 261..but not in this one..
2705,Sound and battery quality is the best you can get in this price range
2706,

2708,Totally worth it!!!
2709,It's totally waste of money
2710,"Sometimes it disconnect, need regural reset of device."
2711,"Sound effect is too low, In cal another side of the person can't hear my voice. More expected but not worth it."
2712,Worst response on call.
2713,Voice not outgoing
2714,Good to use for listening music or for watching movies. Not so recommended for calling purpose and the other feels that we are on speaker even though we can hear them clearly.

2721,I don't expect this sound quality

2723,"When anyone call to someone or you received any call, voice will be reached to us too late."
2724,"I absolutely loved the product. Boat didn't disappoint me. I use it to hear music, film and for daily conversation. So far so fine. I really recommend this to people who r looking for noise cancellation, light weight and easy to use and for good sound quality."
2725,Theost pathetic but from Amazon. And also from boat. Firstly the product doesn't fit well into my ears. When I requested Amazon for a replacement/ exchange for another model of boat they refused saying that it can be replaced only by same model. If the product is not suitable for your ears then what is try point. Moreover the sound quality is not that great. I recommend NOT  TO BUY this product. You'll be stuck with the money. & Product. First time I'm disappointed with Amazon!!!!!
2726,Happy and money worthed
2727,"Never buy boat products‚Ä¶ they have worst customer support. They dont provide replacement after 7 days and no return is applicable in any condition. Even if replaced product is damaged, its not their fault‚Ä¶ never go for boat"

2735,"If you‚Äôre a student and you cannot afford very expensive earphones and all, this is your chance to get an amazing deal, These airdopes are the best electronic product I ever bought, compact box to charge, amazing sound quality, works great :)"
2736,I paid 899/- . Very average. Battery life is good. Sound quality is average. But definitely value for the money spent.
2737,"Don't buy for Communication, the sound to the other side is very low. They will keep you asking be louder. Other wise if you are buying only for entertainment purpose then a good option with low cost."
2738,Battery is best
2739,Best in this price
2740,awesome Amezon delivery and Boat product
2741,It doesn't fits come out from ears again and again dose not have noise cancellation at all didn't expect much bt should be atleast can't even talk to anyone properly
2742,The product quality is overall good in value. The earpods don't fit in my ear but it is not damaged even it has fallen so many times. The sound quality is good. Mic is bad.

2745,"BoaT Airdopes 121v2 are one of the most stylish truly wireless buds you can find in its range. Having used buds by Ptron and Dizo as well, I can say that none of them look as good or are so comfortable. The multi purpose button works beautifully and sound is crisp and clear. However, microphones do not work well enough."
2746,While on call there has problem of voice break wheater in network or not... Doesn't support video call
2747,This product is fantastic. I like it base.

2763,"Good quality branded product sound-wise, in ear fit could have been made more snug,buds falls down doing active movements. (can't use during dance or gym room routines ).Thus 4 stars."
2764,Sound quality wise its excellent. Though I would not recommend wearing it while running or workout. It tends to slide out of ears quite often. You won't be able to focus on your workout completely. It gets annoying to fix it everytime.

2767,Not handy.
2768,Not worth for Bluetooth
2769,Good
2770,Worst product i am buy this product but single day not using so return the item but not taking so kindly taking the item refound payment
2771,These are my personal experiences after using the earbud for around 7 months1. One earbud shows charging but connect and disconnect automatically no sound coming into it just it has been 6-7 months.2. In between earbud stopped charging from case later on automatically started charging after few days.3. Earbud has started heating badly in just 6-7 months.4. Earbud fully charged battery discharges in just 1-2 hours.5. One earbud has stopped working in just 6-7 months and now another earbud has started making lot of noises automatically and seems it will also stop working in next few days.6. Case battery life after 6-7 months is around charging 2-3 times both the earbud  only. One earbud full charging drains around 25% battery of the case.
2772,"Dissapointed with sound Quality.Sone noise during call.Also, sone noice while pkaying Media ...."
2773,Smooth and good
2774,Everything is good
2775,Sogood and the sound Wasson good
2776,Sound quality is good.Pairs one device at a time.Battery life is very good.Sometimes you will have to shout to convey your voice via mic.Overall a good product.
2777,Thanks it is not Fake...
2778,It's good in listening üé∂
2779,Nice product like it...... Bass is not up to mark ... Otherwise all thing is best
2780,Good
2781,Good
2782,Missing beats while listening to music . The sound suddenly drops
2783,Pod stopped working
2784,Like it
2785,Good quality
2786,Quality is good only need to improve the quality of mic while travelling on bike
2787,This is my second purchase in last two weeks but literally only one air dope is working
2788,Bad
2789,Accidentally washed in a washing machine for 40 minutes. Dried them thoroughly and tried charging. They worked.. I am surprised.. Not sure of what works and what doesn't but I am still able to listen to songs :D
2790,Keeps popping out
2791,Clear sound
2792,"Average product. I bought normal wired ear plugs of boat costing around Rs350 and to my surprise they had much better sound quality than this. Also the design is not good , it keeps falling from the ears."
2793,boAt  Airdopes very pooar quality. Saund quality and only one Airdopes working very pooar quality  also Amazon shoping  very pooar quality
2794,I got these 4 days ago I love the sound it's so easy to take it wherever u go and it just gives me a premium feel but the thing that I was amazed was the battery after so long of using it the battery was still high I honestly love these have dropped em 2 times but thankfully nothing happened 10/10 would recommend
2795,The voice quality is bad and their is lot of noise in background the voice is not clear at the other end .Asked the team to refund or replace it with another device.But they have ignored it .It was bad experience shopping with Amazon this time ....I really unhappy with the service they even havent call me to know the issue ....just replaced it with the same buds and the issue is same ....bad sound quality.
2796,Good üëç
2797,After almost two months of use:Pros:Battery quality is good.Noice cancellation is good.Cons:1. Issue faced while calling to someone. You literally have to shout if you are talking over phonecall with someone.2. Sometimes sound gets off randomly for 2-3 seconds.
2798,I mean it's a low budget tws so if you don't have much expectations it should be able to keep you happy
2799,Very nice
2800,Super
2801,Boat is best quality
2802,Go for it. Good for clarity and bass. But do not expect mic quality as its too much to ask for this low price. Buy for listening great music and not for quality calls
2803,"Everything is good. But when we are on a call , its worst mic is not good , the other person will not be able to hear your voice properly"
2804,I am using this for last 2 months. Speacker is very good and build quality is excellent. But inbuild mic not good. It is not functioning after 1 month. You can buy if you get this in offer price
2805,Superb
2806,Satisfy with this purchased .Purchased  at 899 at this price  it's worth at this price
2807,It's very nice in this price but the mic is not good so 4star from me
2808,Not goo
2809,Product is good but range and bass very poor
2810,Amazing bass
2811,Like
2812,Quality is descent and it is lightweight but th most annoying thing is the button whenever u feel it is loose and u try to push it inside then the button is so easily pushed and thus calls get disconnected and music pauses. And it doesn't feel annoying when u read the comment but day to day use its like wtf dude. There is no noise cancellation duh i knew it earlier. Though base is good.
2813,Very Nice productI recommended üëç
2814,Loss feting and poor sound quality

2823,West of money
2824,Awesome product simply luv this

2826,
2827,The sound quality is overall good.The Mic works pretty well too.Decent and affordable.
2828,good product
2829,Good
2830,The device has good sound quality but the only disadvantage is that it does not connect to multiple mobile/device at a time. I have to disconnect it from one to connect in the other.
2831,
2832,It stopped getting charged within a month. Worst product by boat. Though I have wired earphones also of the same and they are working well. But this Bluetooth one isn't worth buying.
2833,Sometimes it will be shown full charged but in next minute you will see it becomes discharge completely. Noise cancellation is not so good.
2834,The product looks good. It's OK while listening to audio. BUT when speaking through it on a call (voice or video) the person in the other side CANT HEAR ANYTHING. Very poor quality.
2835,Boat airddopes is good quality
2836,worst experience by Amazon. I have received damaged product one of the airpod is not working.
2837,I like it
2838,Very bad product because no sound quality no noise cancellation and nothing bass
2839,So good amazing voice enjoying listening music good battery backup
2840,For hearing songs and videos it's valuable but during call it's not ok because our voice isn't much volume to opposite side
2841,It's a very good product üòä

2847,Sound is goodNoise cancellation is very badBass quality is good
2848,The product is nice one. Sound quality is good. Enough backup time is there. The main issue is that when you touch and control the buds an irritating pain will feel our ear üëÇ .
2849,"Value dor money , i got it for 850 , can't ask for more in it. Still if u want details here goes.1. Amazing battery backup of case, lasts for 5-6 days (Real time). we can charge earplugs actually 3 times  100 % from the case and each earplug charge lasts 6-7 hours. Preety sick.2. Music wise sound is good.. dnt expect a boss, JBL quality sound as this is just Rs. 850(its a complement that this price band earphones are being compared to such expensive ones) -SOUND'S GOOD3. SOUND QUALITY and CONNECTIVITY is below average while taking calls .I dnt use it on calls at all now. (no complaints, its good with music4. Above average base and clwar music sound.In such rates no proper brands product is available and what i got is a steal.Go for it or else ur call , jo marzi karo. chao"
2850,
2851,This airpods are awesome..and best in market..sound quality is great..
2852,Sound is good and balanced.Battery backup is also good.Downside is it's not recommended for audio calls as opposite person is not able hear clearly
2853,Whenever I move my head while listening to something using this model the audio gets cut off in middle....it has happened a lot of times till now from day 1 I got this model...seems like there is some issue...check it...I got four models in boat..but this is the one who has issue...it sucks when the audio is cut off in middle while watching something üôÉ
2854,Nice product. Value for money. Mic pick up  is too low. During phone calls other side people face difficulty to listen our voice. Rest all good.
2855,Worst product stop working within 15 days and then send for repairing and then they sent me different+ used+ detected product
2856,I don't like this product because I can't hear right side bud no sound produce
2857,Good quality in low price
2858,First and foremost - they just keep falling off from your ears - so the question of Good bass or sound quality becomes secondary - How can you decide the sound quality of something that just keeps falling off your ears ? Also the case isn't very sturdy.
2859,Good and Comfortable
2860,I have been using this product since 6 months. Sound quality is average and battery life is good. The only problem is with fitment into ear.
2861,Lovely sound quality is gud
2862,Audio at the time of calling
2863,Verry bad experience for calling purpose
2864,"During purchase it was working well. After a month use, suddenly one ear is not working. Even if I charge it in Airpod it never works. Very disappointed with boat"
2865,The  thing that is an issue is that it keeps falling off from the ears And another thing is that we can't talk on phone with the airdopes. The person on the other side doesn't get to hear us well.But yes for listening to music this product is on point.
2866,The sound quality is decent. But after a month the left ear bud stopped working completely one morning. Would not recommend
2867,Nice product in lowest price
2868,"Good but my left bud becomes unfunctional after using it for few months. Bluetooth connection is not fast and one has to manually connect if automatic connection does not function.Sometimes one ear bud connects the other doesnot. The charging is fast but you never get to know the exact % of charge available as it's LED display shows 100% even after 4 hrs of continuous usage.I tried to get it replaced or repaired during my warranty period by mailing to boat customer care, but since last 20 days I m getting sms of product pickup by their courier partner with contact no. But the courier guy confirms to visit and no one is coming to pick it up even after multiple calls. I don't know what is the issue with the pickup not getting done in these days and every day a new courier partner is assigned. Literally fed up with the services! Post sales service is 0 zero.Please don't buy."
2869,"Been using it for more than 7-8 months and I got no problem with it. It's really comforting, sometimes I sleep wearing the pods and I won't even realize it's there, it's really comforting and battery backup is good too and the best audio quality, perfect for jogging and cycling. Pretty satisfied customer aye."
2870,No feature but sounds good can't work on calls
2871,Great sound quality and comfortable to wear.
2872,"I am writing the product review after using it for 3 months. The sound quality is good. Bass is also good. The Bluetooth range is also good.But,CHARGING TO THE BOX IS NOT HAPPENING!!Suddenly charging to the box stopped. Now I have no way to charge the box?"
2873,No bass and sound is very low and is a device voice don't buy this if ur budget is 1k there are many others which are far better than this. Overall product is good to make or answer calls and listen music that's it. Voice assistant is not accurate recognises wrong words even in English natbe language toh bhul hi jao..Not worth..
2874,Noise controls not  so you don't call in croud  out side sound too much so date on calling person can't understand proper on my talk
2875,Music is good but the noise on call is high... U have to speak louder so other would hear clearly... Not for those who r driving bike or to use in traffic...
2876,Not satisfying with the product..... Right bud is not working anymore üò§üò§ i just buy it before 8 days only....! I want to return the product or I need to exchange the product
2877,"Good product but some time connectivity issue occurs, bass is more than worth in 800Rs. Playback time is awesome. need to charge after 4 days with daily usage of 4-5 hours daily."
2878,"It's good to use in daily use, like listing songs, movies.Sounf is okay when we talk over the call, have button to pick the call. The mobile should not be too far otherwise the voice will be breakup. As I said, it's a good product for daily personal use, it's not useful for business calls and meetings due to lack of noise deduction.I am happy with it in this range."
2879,Good product. Value for money
2880,"Good in budget, tried it & got hooked to the ease of use. Though sound quality is just okay for videos not adequate for music...calls were okay, no lag but goes silent for a few microseconds. will be going for a better models I.e. 441...also had a defect with charging/working of the right bud after 4-5 days, tried replacement but stock not available so it will be returned."
2881,Helpful product
2882,These burgers sent defective product and later replaced with already used product and that is also not working
2883,This product is very nice
2884,"The microphone seems to be problematic as attending any online calls, the other side always complain about sound disturbance and unable to hear...always need to disconnect earphones to continue with calls"
2885,"Honestly this product is not Good. Return & Replaced product also same behaviour.1) call back option is not available but present required call back option is mostly2) travel time call voice is not clear & noise3) During Phone Call: Voice not clear and voice break, echoing during ms team meeting call4) Appario Retail Private Ltd: Distribution cheap quality, no Quality check. (Recently I order one mobile - Stop working in one month and I spend 3000rs to repair, one airpod - Completely dead with in 2 month). Totally waste of money when we ordered in Amazon.4) Only Good thing is battery life is Good as per specification.5) Poor pairing & Connective - if u move 3 or 4 meter away from phone bluetooth pairing get disconnected.6) Sound - Look like 100rs headphone sound."

2888,Easy to handle.Battery backup is good .
2889,"First I received a defective item and then i replaced it and received other one which was working but gets disconnected many times, low quality sound, the built quality is also not good, in simple words its just waste of money. I don't recommend to buy this thing its waste and not at all worth the money. Apple ka 1st kya 2nd copy bhi isse accha hota hai or cheap bhi."
2890,"The first time I ordered this product, it was not working. After replacing it, again I got a defective one (the battery display screen was broken). Not happy with the service. Otherwise the product is good- sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality are great."
2891,"I Purchased Boat because I have 2 Boat speakers which is very very good. But this airdopes is really not worth the money. I thought I could got a defective one so I replaced.. but had same issues....Issues:1. Battery was very poor. Music lovers, do not go for it.. Calls ok but that too if you are kind of business guys then again no :)2. Right airdopes was having low volume and there is no way to increase it.3. The Mic was not clear enough.. the other end caller was not able to hear me properly and was asked to repeat the same twice each time.4.  The buttons on the airdopes was hard such that i had to take out press it and then fit it back to my ears.5. Left airdopes kept disconnecting frequently."
2892,Good product but not for bike
2893,Good sound
2894,Using it for almost 1 week now battery & audio quanlity is good can buy if ur budget is below 1300
2895,"I ordered this for my dad, product is good, deep bass, sound quality is also good"
2896,Shi h bs battery ka persent apne aap he kam ho jata h
2897,After six months not working
2898,It looks great and the sound quality is pretty good too. There is a little noise problem when used to make calls and the other person cannot hear without a little muffle. But otherwise a very nice product.
2899,Super and awesome sound
2900,"Excellent product at good pricing. Bought two numbers at Great Indian Sale for 899 each.Had some apprehensions before purchase after reading some negative reviews but product is as per my expectations.Charging also good within 30 minutes or so it goes from 50% to full. I use it for 2 to 3 hours a day and charge stays for more than 4 to 5 days, sometimes even a week.If you want to use it for making calls while on the go then this may not suit you...If you are looking for entry level decent wireless bluetooth then this is the right choice."
2901,As expected boat quality it's very poor product not that much of good quality of bass effect and moreover to specify mic it's very poor quality we need to shout to speak with the other person who's in other side of the call it's sound quality like the person speaking some where away from the mic totally poor quality of product from boat production
2902,Too much pathetic service of Amazon. Have ordered the same product twice and both the time it is not working.Kindly ask your customer executive to call me
2903,Product is extremely bad quality and quite an old model. Charing option is through the old type N connector. Not worth for ‚Çπ999. and may be worth ‚Çπ400.

2951,"The audio output of these buds is pretty good. However, the mic doesn't catch the voice if you are not speaking very loudly. If someone is buying these earbuds for making phone calls then this is not a good choice. Battry backup is very good."
2952,"The color pink is so ugly and looks cheap unlike the picture. Of course there is no noise cancellation but still the sound quality is disappointing. I would return it if I could. And can be too big for some people's ear, keeps falling of the ears."

2961,"Within 10 days of using it, the charging pod has stopped working and there is no nearest support center either. Don't buy it. It's coming from longtime Boat earphone/headphone user."
2962,I use this product for calls (personal/ official). Many times the other end partt is unable to hear me.The range of the product is promised as 10 meters and if I step 5 feet away I loose connection.Voice clarity is as good as mobile and there no special feat in peoduct.Many things to mention but very little time.
2963,"Boat Ear Pods are of good quality.  Sound quality, bass is exceptionally of better quality.BlueTooth connection setup is easy.Only drawback/lacking is sometimes Ear Pods does not hold on to ears and drops off. There could have been better design or some attachment which can hold it tight."
2964,Good
2965,The plugs are too large and hard to stick in the ears. You will also begin to feel pain after a while. Noise-canceling is not good and the other side listeners could hear other noises on my side.
2966,Ok
2967,There is a lot of disturbance at receiver's end when connected via phone or laptop..music is okay but is now worthless for me as I needed it for calls mainly.
2968,I like this product bt I want to replace this product  bcz one is damaged
2969,"Forget bass & all that jazz, the basic sound in the earbuds is soooo low, I can‚Äôt properly hear anything. Noise cancellation is very poor. The earbuds don‚Äôt even fit in my ears properly. They are always almost half hanging outside my ear that i fear all the time to drop them. Very poor product from boat. I bought another earpods of boat earlier, they were superb, darn awesome sound quality & they exactly fitted in my ear, but i lost them. After being disappointed with these earpods, i purchased the previous ones again. This sheer waste of money!"

3034,When I brought 1st product it was very nice... afterwards I lost it..then I buy another one this product not even started...2 Amazon give me replace... thank you Amazon for replacement...now one more time this product is not working..only for 10 minutes..reason after charging battery show in second like 100 to 0 in case...and buds not charging.. showing 10 percent in phone and automatically switch off...now I don't feel like buying this product one more time....but those who want small size bud its perfect for them
3035,Excellent
3036,I got the parcel today which was ordered yesterday the external package was excellent  but when i opened the package there was everything fine with what are all the accessories mentioned on the box.  but the product must be a used one because small pack which consists of usb charging cable is already opened one (repacked) image attached and another thing i need to mention here is the lid of charging case is looseThere was no protection insulation between the terminals  and charging case points (usually will be there in new piece)Sound quality is decent and bass is not mild.Battery backup its too early to judgeThinking of claiming for replacement
3037,Nice product
3038,"I would suggest to ""boat"" please do some work on ""quality check"" before launching a product in market. Because it's ruins the name of company.So it has been 2 months I have been used these airpodes which I purchased by seeing the name of ""boat"". Below is the major ""cons"" 1- Sometimes Mike does work some times it doesn't work when you are on a phone call.2-Some time the charging showing display works sometimes not. When you opened the case3-When you listen audio more than 15 minutes it started giving disconnecting for some milliseconds and it continues.""Pros""1- Sound quality is good as per the price2- Well fitted in ears.3- Battery life is good."
3039,Pros.Sound Is Very goodBass is very goodBattery Backup is Around 5 hours When buds Charged full Without Charging Buds. And Box can charge buds 2.5 times when it's fully charged. and Box take Something 1.5 hours to 2 hours 0 to 100 and buds take somthing 30 minits to full chargeIf you Want to use only for songs and movies than this is best.Cons.But noise cancelation is worst. Do Not Use For Calling.Some Times Facing  Connection Interruption and poor connectivity problem as wellIt Doesn't support in some device.
3040,Long lasting backup
3041,Wow! a underfull product by BOAT I really liked it. The bass is not too good and no too veek. But the thing I really like it for its cool design and audio effect. It has a beet of noise cancelation give a very good feed back. Thank you for that product.
3042,"It's good only to hear songs (purpose I bought this)but when you talk, there are lot of grains I could hear. No good for calls, worth money for just listening songs."
3043,A little too much of bass. Drowns the sound of the mids and highs. Tweek the EQ to get better results
3044,This stopped working on 4th day of purchase. Showing 96%charging but in AirPods it says battery low. Don‚Äôt buy ever. Worst experience for a commuter.
3045,The battery lasts many days when used a few hours a day and the sound quality is also good.
3046,Sound and build quality is fine in this price segment..But the problem is you have push it a bit deep in the ear for good grip and bass and when you use it's button for anything it hurts so I'll just recommend to buy touch ones
3047,Within 3 months of purchase one side of earpiece became non functional.
3048,

3105,"To start off, for the price the boat earbuds hasn't disappointed. The sound and bass is terrific. Compact design and the battery life is worth mentioning about. But all said, Bluetooth connectivity is not as strong as the description say. Manual connection of the left and the right ear bud respectively to be done when connecting the device to your phone. It sure does fit in the ear when you not moving much, but it tends to fall out while you out for a run or when you at the gym.Overall, a good pocket-friendly set of earbuds if you haven't had one before, but it sure is a hassle when you have to fix them to stay in your ear during your work outs or a jog as mentioned earlier. Also if you ride a motorcycle, it surely does not fit inside the helmet. Hence, weigh other alternatives before jumping to buy these just for the price.. Cheers!"

3119,It doesnt get connected to any device. I brought them because boat has quite name. But now nor does it work nor can i return them. It was a gift for someone. U all could have checked the product before packing it for delivery. I am very disappointed in amazon. I could have brought the same product at same prize from offline n would have received fully working air pods
3120,Sound quality is superb.Bass is also great.Noise cancellation is a flop.doesnt work at all
3121,Great product !! Awesome Sound Quality . Must buy product for budget under 1500 .
3122,Good product
3123,"These are worst ever earphones i ever experienced.You keep on shouting over microphone but other side caller will not be able to hear your voice properly.Battery backup is good though but it does not make any sense if you cannot use it for your needs.After purchasing it is still of no use to me as i cannot attend my meetings/classes with this, speak over call during travel or even at home. I have to order another one, got frustrated with this."
3124,Improve bass quality
3125,Sryy this is the best one am not give back
3126,Sort of satisfied with the product...best value for money....i would suggest you to go for the product
3127,Positives: 1) its cheap totally value for money2) sound quality is acceptable3) good battery backupNegetives: 1) Microphone is  not that good.Our voice is not clearly heard by the caller at the other end.2) its a bit bulky
3128,The airdopes are nicely built and easy to use. They fit in perfectly over the ear and was also steady enough to not fall off during a jog. It comes with a case for the airdopes which is also used as a charger case with the battery display. I only have an issue with the battery level display which shows up in the box. Sometimes the airdopes signals a low battery while being used on ear but shows around 35-37% battery when put back in the box.
3129,the noise cancellation is bad. calls are not clear. worst quality product

3137,"Boat has mastered the art of selling defective/substandard products through various sales on different online platforms. While it does seem like a great option to buy these at discounted prices, the product doesn't always turn out to be good. Can say from personal experience of having used 3 boat products. Boat Rockerz 335,385, ear dopes 121., All three didn't last more than 6 months. While boat does provide a replacement if the product has failed in less than 1 year, it is useless because they will replace it with an equally substandard product which will fail again in 6 months and your warranty has expired by then. Better spend a little more and buy a quality product than spend on a substandard one. Highly disappointed."
3138,Bad
3139,These are the best headphones for the price I bought it for 1000 rupees and they are the most genuine Bluetooth headphones the sound quality is amazing and the battery life is way too amazing I rarely need to charge it in weeks you cannot go wrong with them

3143,"Easy to pair and use, the sound quality is pretty cool , noise cancellation is not so great.Bass quality is good. But if u want to play BGIM or and other game it has a sound lag so it could create problem. If u see the product as whole and the pricing it could be little lesser."

Neither it was moving further 80% in charging, nor it was decreasing when I put my earbuds in the charging. Then I decided to replace. When I got the new one in the replacement, the battery of earbuds was 70%. When I put it in the charging case, the battery of case was 100% even the battery of earbuds was 70%, it was not automatically charging. Then When I put it in the charging when it needs only 30% of the charge, my battery of charging case decreased from 100 to 25% directly even when it's feature was to charge the earbuds 3 times.I request you guys not to buy this product...I only hope you all to trust me..."

I thought it would be like regular ones but when I connected and played yes i can definitely say you can go. With it... at 999 definitely a good deal good song good base but miss and lows could be little more better but my verdict.. A difinitly big yess to boat.. Atmanirbhar #useindian if 999 giving this good sound so what the amazing stuff they are giving in higher ranges..Dabba could be better jisme isko rkhte hai üòÇüòÇ..

3182,Charge down  25%-30% in 2 hours.. you hear only shriek treble voice of music‚Ä¶ fitting ear not smooth as other boat models. Every end of second day is charging . Performance of model far below expectations .. not worth buy
3183,"I got the new Boat Airdops Yesterday (28/06/21) it was good but when I took it the box in hand it was like a cheap material used in case of airdopes. When I listen the music the bass was quality poor and not matched at the expectation as I expected. Yes, this is value for money but if you spending this much money just add more money and get a Good ones. In a 1 day the airdpoes getting heated."

3232,I like the feature were it‚Äôs automatically switching between mono and stereo.*Case door (top cover) is little clumsy.*Sometimes it‚Äôs hard to take airdopes out of the case.*Sometimes if airdopes press against ear it makes weird noise (meshes sound I think)

3242,Change button into touch sensor
3243,
3244,*Pros : Great battery life.*Cons : (1) Audio quality gets deteriorated due to the  lack of Bass.  (2) The Boat company should cut down on its gender biasing and especially colour biasing.The customers have to pay an additional sum of Rs. 353/- if they opt for the pink coloured ones instead of the regular black for this device. This is called the Pink Tax from which this company is benefitting unethically.I recommend not to buy the product.

This product is one of worst from boAt company, the sound quality is poor and it's difficult for the other person to listen to what you are saying. Bluetooth connectivity is good and quick. I wanted to return the product, but as it's purchased in festive sale, I can only replace it; even though there's problem with sound and volume, I just cannot return it.

3329,I recommend to not buy this product because the pod were not adjusting in ears it slips when it was in my ear and I accidentally fall down it 3 or 4 times and my one pod is not giving sound I have 1 year warranty card but when I see amozen option I saw that my exchange or regond option is closed my family were so sad and some angry on me this is the wrost air pod ever and you 1200rupees will get wastes I really recommend to not by this product üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò∞üò∞üò§üò§üò§üò§üò§üëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüëøüò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò†üò†üò†ü§ß
3330,
3331,Voice call is not that perfect
3332,Sound quality is decent but within two months of my purchase 1 ear bud charging is not happening.
3333,It is good for people who don‚Äôt want to invest much into earbuds
3334,Very good quality must buy in this price range.Bass is bit lower
3335,"Good product, can be used one piece at a time, automatically switching off when kept in box(good option), charge level shows for kit and airpods seperately.Taking out is little difficult (easily slips from hand).could have tag hole provision for box"
3336,"Everything is fine but one side of the of earpod is broken and unable to hear now how do I claim the warranty for the product, when I get expect the replacement since it has warranty of 1 yr and broke within 6 months"
3337,"Connects quickly once you remove from the case. Sound quality is good except for intermitent pauses. The downside is, during the voice calls the otherside person can hardly hear.So I use these buds only for music and videos."
3338,"Quality I every bad sound ,voice is not gd don't go for it"
3339,Battery backup is goodBut noise cancellation is very bad
3340,"Boat was way too good a few years back when they were just in wired headphone space and over the ear bluetooth headphone space but with TWS, they have reduced the sound quality with an increased price. Even their wired earphones under INR.400/- sound much better than this cheap quality tws. The only pros is the battery life and rest everything sucks, from bass to trebble to build quality."
3341,Meditation & kitchen me kam karte samay me use karti hu superb quality he
3342,"Ok for though who prefers listening to songs, who doesn‚Äôt care‚Äôs about the bass"
3343,Everything is perfectly fine . But one issue . This earbuds is not suitable during calls . For enjoying music and using them while playing games is perfectly awesome at this price point .
3344,Good
3345,It‚Äôs got good sound quality and bass.. it‚Äôs beautiful and great in design as well..the only thing I disliked was it‚Äôs mic quality on calls.. people can‚Äôt hear u properly over calls..
3346,"Initially didn't expect it to work but after 6 months of use. It seems it does work as per it is being marketed. However, if both pods are in use Bluetooth distance get restricted in 15-25 meter readings otherwise with single it's 30 meter. Rest with single pods other party will hear background noise with lower a bit after using two pods but still can be observed."
3347,Good product and bought it in sale which makes it more value product
3348,There is problem in the earphone the sound is cracking i want to return the product can you help me

3353,"I bought this during Amazon great Indian sale 2020 at price tag of 999rs.If you are intrested in buying truly wireless earbuds of branded company this are best.Bass is low but enough.not recommended for gaming.sound quality is between good and average.Cap of case is feels loose.overall good product in this price tag, I am Happy with itüòä"
3354,14 days backup and single time upto 3.5 hours.Buy it the best Entry level TWS earphones
3355,"Third class product. 3 days after one earbud got silent,,without packing no refund,,,"
3356,"While this is one of the very sleek looking pods in the market, it certainly doesnt have a good microphone, and hence cannot be used for making phone calls. The person at the other end keeps saying that the voice is muffled / not clear, and the moment I disconnected the pods in the same position, they could hear me clearly.I bought one pair, and returned it due to this reason, and bought another pair of the same earphones. However, even for the second pair, the same issue persists that the person at the other end cannot hear clearly. I even tried removing one pod from one ear and keeping the other one close to my mouth, but there was no improvement.I would not recommend this product unless this issue is fixed. However, if you are using the pod ONLY for hearing music, then it is a decent buy."
3357,Small issue is felt sometimes it gone a romove from ears. But actually not. Some times Bluetooth mic is not working properly.it is not comfortable to speak phone calls compared to wired ear phones. Other wise videos songs and all it given a good experience to hear.
3358,Nice product

3370,Left eardopes not working must after a month of purchase. Also giving pain on outside of my ear.
3371,"Works well with my android mobile. I can clearly hear the voice and my voice is clear to the listener. Fits well in ears.Tried using this with HP laptop calls, Listener cannot hear me properly.This is good for mobile."

3376,Excellent sound quality....
3377,"I just use for 2months and product stop working don't espect this result from boatPlease don't buy this product,waste of money"
3378,Sound quality is good but it's not so durable if you are working out Or running and it got slip from your ears than it'll be split in two parts. So be very careful while using it during workout or running.
3379,Little bit Bluetooth connectivity problem otherwise it is a good product
3380,Sound effect not good
3381,"all good(sound, battery backup,build qualitt) except weight, heavy , sometimes drops from ear.would recommend boat 131 instead of this one."

3388,"Just in a Month getting issue of products, from day 1 facing issue of voice call.. Echo sound while calling or low voice..Now right ear dops not working...Can't heard music also"
3389,Not for calling purpose ...
3390,Other person can't get my voiceWhile in call
3391,
3392,Probably the worst TWS you can buy at this price. Please look for a better product than wasting your money on this. The sound quality is crap and don't even try to make a phone call with this and expect the other person to hear anything you say. Battery life is poor as well. The case quality is so poorly built that it feels like the hinge is broken. But that's just what you can expect from boat. Poorly designed and useless products being sold for cheap.
3393,Just after few uses one of the eardopes broke. Sound quality ok. But build quality really poor
3394,After about 2 months one ear buds lost its sound don't know why is there any way to get it replaced
3395,It's amazing or way more better for this price range.don't listen to any negative comment.i have been using this for the past 7 days. I haven't charged it after the first charge and I still have some battery left .The bass is awesome .The sound is also very loud and clear.Good for calling and also for sending voicemails.Good noise cancellation.it is perfect for my ears it is not falling off. I does my workout wearing this.but there are chances it won't fit for some .so there is return and replacement options available.so don't step back just go for it üëç
3396,Very bad quality earphone. Would not recommend anyone
3397,1 star less because... On call or video meeting voice is very low.... And sometimes voice go in between..... But this is happen with every  airdopes
3398,"So i bought this a couple of days ago. Since it's my first wireless Bluetooth category purchase, i didn't really know what to expect. I found the sound quality and noise cancellation to be okay, like 3.5/5. But the main issue with the airdopes is mic. It has the worst mic. I'm seriously disappointed with the quality of mic. But other than that is pretty okay given the budget."
3399,best product by selling for amazon but delivery is very long time and packing is a good Thanks for amazon
3400,Mic not working properly... Mic Sound is low
3401,"Over the period of 4 days, I have bought and returned 4 products. I'm holding 2 now, will return them as well.A big con is the call quality. The other person will not be able to hear you clearly. Period. For all the 6 airpods, I had the same problem."
3402,"Nice products , battery backup is good . But fitting in ear not much good enough ."
3403,Boat Airdopes is Good product.
3404,Ok
3405,Otherwise sound quality is üëå
3406,No noise cancellation. Un fit for ears. Voice quality is worst. Automatically disconnect from mobile.
3407,I  like but product cost is high and I use this product for mobile use purpose.the product is not  properly fitted with ears.
3408,Sound quality is good. Bass and other effects are ok. But mic is problematic. Person on the other side does not get clear voice. Echoing effect is there. Can be useful for listening music etc But not good for calling or speaking in phone
3409,Only disadvantage is esealy fell down from ear
3410,Nice Product.  It's the same thing as it looks. The sound is also good. The delivery of Amazon ones is also very good. I am very happy with this product. Thank you.
3411,The first few days it was working fine and there was no issue. Now sometimes  one eardope works and one doesn't. Then suddenly both eardopes starts working. Hence the noise cancelation becomes excellent. Sometimes when the sound quality is not very good it causes in poor noise cancelation quality.
3412,Both ear buds don‚Äôt work simultaneously‚Ä¶.have to use one only at a time‚Ä¶no return policy or support
3413,"After 20 days of use, left side piece stopped charging. Mic receive very low on what we speak during calls. Falls of for people having small ear. Overall ok product for 899 offer price. But charging problem persists for many users. Ordered for warranty replacement."

3431,üëçüëçüëç
3432,One of the best TWS at this price range. The only drawback is that it has no noise cancellation so there's too much background noise when on call. Otherwise excellent product
3433,It came in two days and it is not fixing in the ear properly. Always it is falling down but another than that the sound quality is good and clear it is worth for buying bought it for 1299rs

No noise cancellation and able to hear very low voice by the receiver during voice call. I planned to return the product but only replacement is available. So placed a replacement and the product delivery happened the very next day. Not sure, the replacement product is sold from the same seller.

3492,"Design looks very cool, good value for money"
3493,Mouthpiece not working
3494,Well there seems to be a problem with the left earphone. It keeps interrupting while I am listening to something. It says Oops! Battery weel every 1-2 minutes. This is really disturbing. The eardopes are fully charged and even the problem persist.I need an exchangeReally a bad/defective pieceOtherwise the sound quality is good.Really appreciate if this is taken back.

3496,Sound quality is bad and also low volume in listening song and calls
3497,Sound quality good but gaming experience not good and build quality is not good
3498,
3499,About this product so fine and battery pickup nice it's so comfortable
3500,Sound and quality is very good.  Case is bit loose. But overall the product was very good. But after 2 months of usage one side stopped working.
3501,"I ordered it keeping in mind I can return it if it will not be upto the mark but it exceeded my expectations.  Sound good , built quality is good too. Battery life is decent as I use it only for conference call and watch movies in mobile sometime. It looks nice as you can see in pics. Under this budget you cannt get better than this. If you want to see my video on this. Please check out my video on YouTube."
3502,Sound is not clear during calling
3503,I just want it for calls but surprised no one can here my voice while I m using itI have to take a call direct no use of earpods
3504,Good product
3505,"The sound quality in general isn't great. The bass in the right ear piece is skewed, causing the sound to split even at medium volume. Battery life is so-so.Also, it keeps falling out of the ear which is superr bad coz you can lose it and have no way to trace it.Sometimes it has trouble connecting but the typical ""switch off and on"" usually resolves it.Bottomline, better to stick with their regular bluetooth earphones instead of these since you cant know quality without using and then on using you can't return it."
3506,The pods worked for exactly one day. And then stopped. What's a waste of money. Kindly avoid
3507,Everything was perfect but one of my earpods stopped working after 2&¬Ω months...I first thought its battery got drained but it wasn't...I'm going for a replacement... probably I'll get one..
3508,Quality and value for money this product long dividy good and super product thnk u Amazon...
3509,Just go for it. It is nice. Mine fell frm about 4.5-5 feet and it still works completely fine. Just buy it and yes it is worth buying it the price isn't tooo much and it is affordable. I have been using it for abt more than 8months and it works fine. I have put the review this late coz I wanted to check how is the product and then review it.
3510,Supar
3511,Ok
3512,Need better manual instructions

3517,Good
3518,No bass . Waste product. Better go with other product.
3519,Every thing was good till one month then one earbud stopped working later on the other
3520,Veryy disappointed!... Right raebud is not working.. Didn't expect this from boat... Going to return it
3521,Improve sound effect more..
3522,It's been a treat to my ears. Super comfortable and fantastic sound quality.Voice call ain't good at all so consider this before buying.But music is so good with this cutie. I would recommend it.
3523,Very bad experience not sound quality issues
3524,I like the way it sounds. It has a good output quality. I also enjoyed the bass. But when it comes to mic it's not up to the mark. People on the other side of the call are always complaining about low sound quality. Voice is not clear and sounds muffled. This is a huge turn off. I will recommend this product only if you're not concerned about microphone.
3525,This is the best product  ever.. boat company  is very gud.. sound is amazing.. value of money rs.999 only...
3526,Everything is nice but if you are buying this product for gaming it's not good it's not recommended for game by bus if you are good you should bring this for listening to music so it's quite nice and it's battery life is also nice and the one thing I do not like in this airdopes that that it would not fix  well in my ears and sometimes in  pain in my ears
3527,Average
3528,I have by this product by 10 august 2020 and i have replace it for one time for the voice cancelation and not proper voice during calls. But it cannot fix again by the company so rating out of 2/10 plz fix it otherwiser help me what i can do to fix it
3529,Good
3530,Product is good... Having amazing noise cancellation quality... But the case quality is not good as per expectations.... But overall the airdopes are of good quality.... Music clearance is too good....
3531,Bass n sound quality is impressive but noise cancellation make trouble...
3532,Sound quality is okay but battery back is inadequate. Mic quality is poor and listeners on other end face serious problems in picking up the voice of caller.
3533,Most of all i like the battery life. Firstly I have this once and used it upto maximum 10 days. 2 hours per day. But i am not comfortable with phone call. We can't talk comfortably with dis.
3534,Nice
3535,The noise cancellation is just below average and the person on the other side can hear a lot of disturbances while on call. For music? It is okayish.
3536,"Based on the review I purchased it, but to be honest not at all worh it.1 ear bud always tend to stop working."
3537,Nice quality
3538,No not like waste of money
3539,"I would suggest not to buy this product. Is of no use. Sound quality is worse, Mic is not working, bluetooth is not connecting, it has very poor conectivity The person on the other side of the call can't even listen my voice."
3540,I don't like this product bcoz no return policy no warranty
3541,I want return my payment because the product is used that I received.
3542,It's good phone with long battery life and sound quality. Only big drawback is it doens't have volume control ..while it has no speaker it can't be expected in that price range
3543,"Not at all good for calling, background voice is is more than the callers voice... Dont buy this"

3564,My eardopes are not charging properly. please advise.
3565,"I may have given it less stars,but it's really hard to complain when you get it for 999 but if you buy it for near 2000 it is absolute garbage, the connection range is I think 15 cm and I am not exaggerating, the sound quality is like 1950 but it does have a nice battery indicator, I hope other premium manufacturers do that, but for near 2000 you can get a good headphone"
3566,Songs are stopping to go on
3567,Nice products
3568,Go for it

3585,Product is very good but mic doesn't work properly because mic is in the ear and it doesn't catch sound properly. So if you're on the phone call then opponent person can't hear your voice clearly. Otherwise sound is good.
3586,I'm happy with the sound quality . But the fact that it falls out of your ears while you are doing chores or having a run . Its really irritating .
3587,Good quality. Recommended to buy.
3588,I liked the productWorth to buy at this price but left airdrops aree not getting charged !! 1st 2 days worked after that it stoped !!üôÇ
3589,Bad product
3590,Range is very poor
3591,Good if you are buying the product just to listen to music. Not a very good option for taking calls as the background noise pretty much takes over the voice of the speaker. I returned the product because it did not give clarity to the voice over call to the other recepient.
3592,Amazing sound quality
3593,Highly recommend..100% worthful
3594,Value for money product.What it says it sells .Very lightweight as very comfortable.Perfectly fits in ear.
3595,I purchased this product but one earbud of this product was not working. Didnt exoect this from boat. May be due to Made in China product was defective.
3596,Good product
3597,Nice sound with bass but call quality is not good. The person on other side of the call get muffled voice
3598,Product stoped working within 3 monthsHardly used 5-7 timesBoat has a very long way to goBetter to buy reputed product
3599,"The sound quality was good,no complain but the bass was not upto expectation which was kinda dissapointing. But it was worth for the price."
3600,Well for me it's full Paisa wasool product with boats and it's quality.No compromise found. Important is how to use it. Choose the right size rubber grips to fit in your ears else just press it a little properly to experience the quality of sound.Most importantly use a music player and equaliser settings of your mobile when you want experience the quality of sound. It is wrong to judge the sound quality by listening music on online apps.That's alll. Battery life and recharge all is having many other aspects so it differ from usage to usage of an individual.Enjoy !!
3601,"After use from 1 month, earbuds works fine no issue found, sound quality not so good but connectivity and design are awesome, must buy product"
3602,"I use boat wired headphone bought in ‚Çπ350/- in 2020. It has amazing sound quality along with good noise cancellation. Only for the brandname, I ordered this Bluetooth Airdopes 121v2, which has poor noise cancellation, poor quality of voice calling, mediocre quality of sound. In 1k which is ""okay"" for me. And after only 15days, right ear's pod stops working"
3603,Best in branded starting range. Good battery life.
3604,Very good product
3605,"Sound and bass is okPocket mei phone rkh k isse baat krne mei problem hoti h, sometimes same wale ko awaz nhi jati thik seAlthough nice product at this price rangeYou can go for it or should increase your budget by 300-400 there are many more options"
3606,"Using it since Nov 15th 2020, so far reasonably good, I got it for rs. 900, thanks Amazon for discount, if you use both earbuds only only one side works as Mike, which is obvious & right, if you use only one earbud either side can work as Mike, sound quality satisfactory, Bluetooth connectivity satisfactory, build quality satisfactory, since 15th I have charged the battery only once, seems reasonably good battery backup. If you get it for less than rs. 1000 its a very good purchase."
3607,Sound base is superb ... But during a call the voice is not reachable. Overall the product is good and best for music lovers ‚ò∫Ô∏è
3608,Worst product when it comes to calling.The other person on call can hear only background sounds not yours. To much voice dropping. Also dead gap in between song being played. Never expected this from a brand like boAt. Now facing charging issues also.They attended only charging issues and in their report they mentioned it is physically damaged. They don't even care to provide details just physically damaged.
3609,üíØ
3610,It's not working in only 3 months of its purchase date.
3611,Otherwise good but Amazon delivery is very fast 100/100
3612,Usefull product
3613,"I purchased this product on Nov-2020 and it's been over a month now since I'm using this product. I observed the following features in the product :-Pros:-1. Good battery life.2. Good sound quality.Cons :-1. Bluetooth connectivity is not good. Earbuds does not catch signal in curved paths.Overall, I had an average experience from this product due to poor bluetooth connectivity. But, I think that it's good value for money. However, I would still recommend you to purchase this model if your budget is low, else you can consider other options."
3614,Issues for my device...Frequently having issues in connection. Had to reconnect everytime for Mike to work..
3615,The audio is good but the mic is not effective this causes a lot's issues during calls with people unable to hear me properly. At times I need to hold one of the ear dopes in my hand so that people can hear me properly. If you are just looking for this to listening music then it is worth buying or else it is not
3616,Kya batau uske baare mai calling kerke mat dekhna nahi to samne wala wahi se pather fek ke maarega because not good for calling.
3617,Can't b use while calling....unavle to listen hear vouce properly...Within a 1 mnth one airpode is not working
3618,Dislike
3619,If you are buying this for hearing music alone then this is the best choice. But you can use this for voice calling the audio quality during voice call is so poor.
3620,Nice soundLooks very prettyVery light weightN good for the money totallyMust buy if anyone's looking for such an optionCharging lasts for quite long n the case is very handy to carry

3638,"Thought the product quality would have been better, thinking it is boat brand..."
3639,"The Airdopes 121v is an amazing product. The Sound quality, noise cancellation and base quality are very good. I'm writing this review after 1 year of use and it has never failed my expectations. You can go for it if you want below Rs.1500. It has fast charging and these Airdopes are very strong that it has fallen down from a short height for more than 5 times and it didn't cause any damage."
3640,"However noise cancellation and bass is not good, more averageish. Sound Quality is decent, could be better though, however good Value for money."

I am able to connect my Bluetooth speaker with my laptop but this cannot be connected. So issue is definitely with this device and not with my laptop. Also it's but tricky to hold in ears.. it keeps falling down after sometime, no matter how well I put it. So people who are buying for running or walking, think about that. It popped out when even when you are still or sitting, don't think it will sustain when you are on the move."

3774,In total budget airdopes and if you are looking for something in this budget well today there are alot more options but this too is a good option.
3775,THANKU SO MUCH
3776,After few months one side earbud is not audible. it's good to use but don't throw down & don't make it fall down

3779,For this money it's a worth buying product.Like any product it also has its pros and cons. The only con  I have experienced is the blue colour lighting on the earbuds .. it's very inconvenient to have that light especially during night time. Well it has nothing to do with the products quality . And battery life is quite impressive too .So over all its a good product.
3780,Good
3781,"I have already used the boAt product are found no critical issues. This one is also good. The design is awesome, Sound is also good, but the voice clarity is not up to the mark. The other side person doesn't hear properly and you speak loudly to make the other person understand (Microphone Feature is not as expected.)"
3782,"This is replaced product I believed I'll get good one from Amazon but this is also got damaged in charger case down(RHS), I felt very bad bcoz of its my wife anniversary giftüòî atleast can I get good new charger case.."
3783,Good product only one problem it's ear fitting is not good when we walk it may be fall dawn
3784,Good product in this price Range
3785,Maximum time people complain that they are unable to hear the voice....what could be the reason...boat is a brand they should work on this feature so that the brand image could ve maintained
3786,"Its just for normal gaming, if u want best sound experience then not a good idea to buy this and the device I bought was not fully ok, the lid of the eardope box was completely loose and charge finishes very fast"
3787,"Nice design. But I find the pressing buttons little bit nasty. I go for adjusting the positions, button press happens.Apart from that, sound quality is good. Not great. A decent and simple buy.One drawback I found is, no internal volume adjustment is present. So only Device connected, volume can be adjusted.Another one, claiming 3-4 hours audio playback. Could have atleast 5. Need to verify . Will be updating shortly.OVERALL A NICE PRODUCT WITH NICE SOUND QUALITY"
3788,"After 6 months of use, my experience with this product was good but this is no scratch proof that's not good and unsatisfying. Sometimes errors in connectivity."

3795,When speaking to someone the noise is very bad
3796,Good
3797,When on calls echo sound unable to hear properly. Review on same
3798,"Using for 6months, initially everything was fine with this product so I even bought one more...but both of them were working fine. now my set is gradually loosing its volumeand in other set left side one is low on volume. Problem is in this pandemic situation the company only supports warranty if you take them to nearest service center."

Charging case build quality is low grade even battery display inside the box not showing the battery accuracy.4.

3960,Best
3961,Good
3962,The sound in this cost is very amazing and is very clear. If you will full the volume than also you will not feel that the sound is cracking. Bass quality is amazing if you will keep it pish in your ear but as you will release it and wear normally it will not amazing but yess it is not bad
3963,The product is good for gym usage but not good for calls. The voice echoes and unclear to the person on call.Bass is good but microphone needs improvement for calling purposes
3964,For listening music best buy of this price but for calling it's little bit poor sometime...
3965,good battery life.& audio
3966,Good product
3967,the only thing I disliked about the product is neither I can use any extra ear guard to hold the airdopes from falling off from my ears nor I can change the product with other boats' product due to the policy...
3968,Not good
3969,Sounds
3970,Nice

3975,Not properly fitted in ear..as a result noise cancellation is very poor..despite changing size of the caps.
3976,The charging cable is useless
3977,Please don't buy if you can afford better one. It's been one month doesn't charge and the indicator  is kind of Annoying. It just doesn't worth the money instead one can opt for wired one's.
3978,Very good

3998,"The quality of the mic is very poor and the person on the other side can not hear anything properly even when I was indoor with no noise around me. I also did not receive extra ear tips in the box. Build quality is okay for the price. Sound quality for music is good for the price. But it lacks terribly in the most basic use, that is how this product's mic sounds, which is very very poor. I never used of heard of any product which can be this bad on mic. Rs.50 earphones have better mic. I was going to throw it in the garbage area in front of our house, but trying to replace the product and see if the other one is little better. The problem is, they focused on splash proofing the product and there is no gap for the voice to go in. It is totally muffed. It sounds like mic is under a pillow and person is talking through the pillow. Don't buy it. Spend little extra and get realme buds q may be"

Noise cancellation wasn't upto par. Overall very disappointed.I would recommend the Airdope 441 over this.

4073,I am writing this review on the third day after I bought it. It is profitable for this price. The music is awesome to listen to.  Getting battery above 15hrs.  But it is not useful for calling.  What we say is not clear to the person speaking to us.
4074,"Everything is good , except the range of bluetooth."
4075,"Feels light, looks good sounds good.Left earpiece keeps breaking sound. Not happy with it."
4076,Sound is not good for game so and half kept miss also no sound can you give us more sound earbuds and for games
4077,Mic is not good hence while calling the sound is distorted even in indoor places. Otherwise good for just listening to songs or watching movies.

Boat claim 380 mah capacity of case but how should possible only 2time buds charged & 1st time more reduce case for each buds charged & 2nd time only(7%). I use alternative each buds so no more need to case charge require 4dys, sound & bass is well somehow no more expected. Buds r pain in ear after long 1hrs used,  call quality & noise reduction no more expect bcze it some how ok buttons is very hard & üîä make, no IPX water üí¶ proof & batterybackup each buds  3hrs got connectivity only each 1 time mobile or smart tv etc. so all of my opinion last 20days useing 50/50 it ok but price rage it costlyno ipx case quality cheap if it felt then easily broken Buds plastic quality ok."

I am hered that boat company products are useless and now they told to replace but the service is also worst. Bekaar China mall."
4089,Using this product over a month now. Enjoying the hands-free while a walk or gym.Pros: The sound quality is great and also the noise cancellation works to perfection. Full marks to that.Cons: Problem with mic. While speaking over a call the other person hears a lot of disturbance of surroundings no matter how far the sound is coming from. Lot of shaking while doing walk n talk.Overall satisfied.

4091,"This product is good but , whenever used this in online meetings and video call .then voice break lot . Mic doesn't working properly and sound was not clear .they showing lot of problems while connected on internet call and Video chat ."
4092,The bass is very poor. The sound is not well rounded but harsh. Moreover the left earbud seems to be not functioning fully. It has a much lower sound than the right one. Dissapointed with the quality of the product.
4093,Audio is not clear. Unable to hear voice because of background noise n connection break

4109,"Product is good according to the price, sound is good, but mic is not good, you need to speak louder while taking calls. I'm satisfied with product. Some minor issues, but over-all the product is good. You should go for this."

4111,Received product but 1side earpod not working even after factory reset. So asked for replacement but received the product which is used one. Can able to see scratches. And additional ear buds are missing in the replacement.Not satisfied with the delivery of the replacement but quality of sound is good.
4112,"I think that it was good product but there quality was poor, within 6 month my left earphone was unable to work . Im disappointed."
4113,The battery life is fairly good.The product design and size is compact and snuggly fits into the ear.The sound quality is also good. Only once in a while especially when you walk around with ear buds speaking or listening to music the sound goes off and on which is an irritant.Else over all the product is a good buy.

Waste of money.
4155,Clarity is only good. Rest everything not worth. If you are buying just for the comfort and clarity go for it. The drivers are small which is the reason for reduced bass. Overall good product but wouldn't give full rating.

4177,I was expecting a little more better sound quality and Mic. But I still recommend; at this price it is still a better deal. The noise cancellation is not good but the person on the other side of the call can you hear the voice just fine. So that way you can use it for both music and for your meetings or phone calls. The rest of the features like range battery back up design are all okay. Even volume controls could have been provided.

And also this is not fit to my ear .  Mic quality was poor becouse there is no noise cancellation . So it disturbs call . I can't whatsapp call becouse it turn off wifi . Also normal call becouse of low quality mic. Can use for listening music and watching videos . In my case I wasted money .

No any issues of disconnection the other one can here you easily even when you are talking slow.6) Have buttons instead of touch which is more convenient to use.Cons:-1) Case quality can be better.2) Range is only about 8 mtrs not 10.

4493,"First thing first it is not returnable but only replaceable. So if it doesn't suit you, there is no point of replacement. Second thing is, one need to really make efforts to take the ear drops out from the box. They cant't be taken out so easily and some times fall down in the process.  The size of the covers provided with the ear drops is not suitable for small size ears. Even while using with the smallest size of covers, it drops from the ears. You may visualise the discomfort and difficulty in case you are using during travel in a Bus, Train or Aircraft and with little bit of shaking of head if it drops then you had it. The Battery life is very low, after three months of usage, the Battery goes down to 50% by just keeping in the charging box for 2-3 days even when you don't use. Another difficult part is while you are in a zoom or google meet attending some meeting or conversation and if you try and adjust its position in the ears, the top buttons of the ear drops are so big and sensitive that with light touch of your fingers, it gets you disconnected from the meeting or conversation. It's a big problem as you need to make efforts to connect to the meeting all over again. So as I said not very user friendly and convenient at all."

4497,Good
4498,"This first and foremost drawback about this product is that this headset doesn't have a mic. If you're wearing this, you still have to speak into the phone. It means this is only good for listening.The sound quality and bass is very good. Battery life is not very good I guess. Value for money, definitely NO. If they could put so many things into this little headset, they could have accommodated a microphone too."

4618,To be Honest Review GuyzzzDon't Buy it really worst product. Mazor issue is the connectivity issue and one airpode is stop working after 2 days. Amazon do not have refund policy.

Extremely good.Noise cancellation- almost negligible.Sound quality- good if ignore connection issues."

Sound quality is superb. Overall a worthy pick. Sometimes one of the airdope stops working then u may have to plug it in the charger compartment again and take it off, as mentioned in the manual.I'm writing this after almost 5 months of usage.

4751,It's not working properly waste of money
4752,I purchased this 2 months back. From the beginning I am facing a issue that the call audio quality is very poor. The hearer is not able to hear my voice clearly. They are telling there is some noise disturbance. So I am using this only for music and video purpose not for call audio purpose.
4753,"Receirvd the product with hopes of using these while working out or other processes.The music is moderate, as you'd expet from a costly earset. The build quality is so low that it dropped from my ears and it broke into two disconnecting the microphone wiring from the inside. I am extremely unhappy with the product. There's been no communication from the company side either."

4762,Thank you Amazon for proper packing and shipping the product which we had purchased.Sound quality is good. Noise cancelation is also good but one problem which we are facing suddenly dropped/ cut the voice during call or listing music or watching series.Battery back up is good.Overall good product in price range.
4763,Good
4764,After buying defect came into notice within 15 days. The rt eardope started malfunctioning and wasn't getting charge properly
4765,Good
4766,Good
4767,It's a good product but mic is not advance or good as it has to be...  Voice is not clear from the mic otherwise good buy
4768,"I got it replaced as the one which I ordered stopped working and this new one also is not performing well., In between the voice is getting lost . Not happy with boat for this one.. after using for 6 months one earpod is not working"
4769,Good
4770,"Good enough to use it indoor. But since it may fall from your ear, it is advisable not to use outside like running, doing gym...etc etcRest it is good"
4771,One side is not working need replacement
4772,Sound quality is very bad.Waste of money.
4773,I ordered this earphone and it arrived in 2 days which was unexpected as it was showing to deliver in 4 days.Product quality was very good as most of the items comes first copy or duplicate. This is the original.Sound is perfect with smooth bass and treble. Clear voice while talking. Both the recipients hear clear voices. No double voice to the receiver side. This is common in some good earphones of this type as i have experienced. Even Samsung's earphone has this problem of double voice. Have to check with noise cancelling which I am unable to check right now. Hopefully that too must be good. Overall good deal for Rs999.
4774,"Very very very low quality product, after product services are also not even good, compared to any device the product itself a trash, not even working for 2-3 months. I will never buy any BOAT devices again."
4775,Everything thing is best just calling system is some not good
4776,My airpods are not working and  not connected ?
4777,Boat airdopes are good . But one of the dopes have bluetooth issue keeps disconnecting even after factory reset of dopes.
4778,Fantastic product and worth for the spend
4779,Good
4780,"Good sound quality.It is taking 2hrs to fully charge and it is retaining its charging capacity for 2 days.satisfied with sound quality,charging time and it is also fitting easily and comfortably in ears."
4781,"I had to revise the Ratings from 3 to 1. I so much wanted to drop it to 0 as the left ear bud committed suicide and it wont charge. So buyers think before before investing in such DUD brands.I'm being objective so it helps other buyers in making a choice.Pairing- it gets paired in an instant but at sometimes you will even find the right bud pairs and the left doesn't get on at all. It also might have to do with the seconds gap in removing the eardopes from the box. But this could have been avoided.Sound- clear ,precise. Bass could have been better. Background cancellation - pretty good when you are listening to.music ....but ..but .. not when you are on calls. People can hear an ambulance siren 300 m away . That's not background noise cancellation. This means it picks up frequencies.Grip- grips well while running. Might have come off once or twice due to sweat ..but overall grips well. Remember there is a certain way you put those buds.On and off-  this one is frustrating .. slightest touch when u feel those buds are coming out and u want to push them in... they go OFF."
4782,
4783,"Guyss it's better to purchase earphone or bluetooth from local shops ,instead of this brand.1.Sound is just worst2.no good coverage at all3. Customer care no is always engaged.4.just waste of money. There is no option for half star that's why I have given one star."
4784,"I'm reviewing after using 3 weeks, sound quality all are good but indication of the battery is the problem when we connect to the mobile always showing 100,when we see on the airpods it indicates different. So finally my opinion is if there is with no problem with it, it's  good product üôÇ"
4785,
4786,Writing a review after approx. 3 months of use. product is good in sound quality and bass.But due to repeated usage the plastic trim/ cover opens up while lifting up from the box.

4788,It's a good earbud at this price range
4789,Require of  more quality in Bass&treble.
4790,Worth to buy at this price range.
4791,"Sound quality for music is excellent, but call quality is really bad. The microphone is not able to pickup the voice and sounds muffled to the listener.If intent is to use for music only then excellent product with good noise isolation at this price point."
